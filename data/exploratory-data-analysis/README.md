standards:
  interpret-single-measure:
    name: Summarize, represent, and interpret data on a single count or measurement variable
    description: This standard covers summarizing, representing, and interpreting data on a single count or measurement variable.
    objectives:
      0: Use statistics appropriate to the shape of the data distribution to compare center (median, mean) and spread (interquartile range, standard deviation) of two or more different data sets.
      1: Represent continuous data with plots on the real number line (histograms and boxplots).
      2: Interpret differences in shape, center, and spread in the context of the data sets, accounting for possible effects of extreme data points (outliers).
      3: Represent categorical data with bar graphs.
  interpret-multiple-measures:
    name: Summarize, represent, and interpret data in multiple categorial and quantitative variables
    description: This standard covers summarizing, representing, and interpreting data in the following -  two categorical variables, two quantitative variables, one categorical and one quantitative variable.
    objectives:
      0: Represent data on two quantitative variables on a scatter plot, and describe how the variables are related.
      1: Construct and interpret two-way frequency tables of data when two categories are associated with each object being classified.
      2: Represent data on two categorical variables in the form of both stacked and side-by-side bar charts.
      3: Represent relationship between one categorical and one quantitative in the form of overlayed histograms and multiple boxplots (one per category).
