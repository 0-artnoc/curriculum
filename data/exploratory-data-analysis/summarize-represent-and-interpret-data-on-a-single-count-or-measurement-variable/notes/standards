In order to fully cover this standard, a performance must be recorded for each of the following objectives:

* Use statistics appropriate to the shape of the data distribution to compare center (median, mean) and spread (interquartile range, standard deviation) of two or more different data sets.
* Represent continuous data with plots on the real number line (histograms and boxplots).
* Interpret differences in shape, center, and spread in the context of the data sets, accounting for possible effects of extreme data points (outliers).
* Represent categorical data with bar graphs.
