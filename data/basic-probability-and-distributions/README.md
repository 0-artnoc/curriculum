standards:
  independence-and-conditional-probability:
    name: Use independence and conditional probability to interpret data
    description: This standard covers the use of independence and conditional probability to interpret data.
    objectives:
      0: Describe events as subsets of a sample space (the set of outcomes) using characteristics (or categories) of the outcomes, or as unions, intersections, or complements of other events (“or,” “and,” “not”).
      1: Understand that two events A and B are independent if the probability of A and B occurring together is the product of their probabilities, and use this characterization to determine if they are independent.
      2: Define the conditional probability of A given B as P(A and B)/P(B), and interpret independence of A and B as saying that the conditional probability of A given B is the same as the probability of A, and the conditional probability of B given A is the same as the probability of B.
      3: Recognize and explain the concepts of conditional probability and independence in everyday language and everyday situations.
  probability-compound-uniform:
    name: Use the rules of probability to compute probabilities of compound events
    description: This standard covers the use of the rules of probability to compute probabilities of compound events.
    objectives:
      0: Find the conditional probability of A given B as the fraction of B’s outcomes that also belong to A, and interpret the answer in terms of the model.
      1: Apply the Addition Rule, P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) – P(A and B), and interpret the answer in terms of the model.
      2: Apply the general Multiplication Rule in a uniform probability model, P(A and B) = P(A)P(B|A) = P(B)P(A|B), and interpret the answer in terms of the model.
      3: Apply the Law of Total Probability, P(A) = P(A and B) + P(A and B’), and interpret the answer in terms of the model.
      4: Apply the conditional probability of A given B as P(A and B)/P(B), and determine independence of A and B as situations in which the conditional probability of A given B is the same as the probability of A, and the conditional probability of B given A is the same as the probability of B.
  expected-value-variance:
    name: Calculate expected value and variance and use them to solve problems
    description: This standard covers the calculation of expected value and variance and use of them to solve problems.
    objectives:
      0: Define a random variable for a quantity of interest by assigning a numerical value to each event in a sample space; graph the corresponding probability distribution using the same graphical displays as for data distributions.
      1: Calculate the expected value of a random variable; interpret it as the mean of the probability distribution.
      2: Calculate and interpret the variance of a random variable
      3: Develop a probability distribution for a random variable defined for a sample space in which theoretical probabilities can be calculated; find the expected value and variance
      4: Develop a probability distribution for a random variable defined for a sample space in which probabilities are assigned empirically; find the expected value and variance
  covariance-correlation:
    name: Calculate covariance and correlation and use them to solve problems
    description: This standard covers the calculation of covariance and correlation and use them to solve problems.
    objectives:
      0: Develop a probability distribution for two random variables defined for a sample space in which theoretical probabilities can be calculated; find the covariance
      1: Develop a probability distribution for two random variables defined for a sample space in which probabilities are assigned empirically; find the covariance
      2: Describe correlation and its perils with respect to Anscombe’s quartet
      3: Distinguish correlation and causation
  probability-outcomes:
    name: Use probability to evaluate outcomes of decisions
    description: This standard covers the use of probability to evaluate the outcomes of decisions.
    objectives:
      0: Weigh the possible outcomes of a decision by assigning probabilities to payoff values and finding expected values.
      1: Find the expected payoff for a game of chance
