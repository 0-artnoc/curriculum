    name: Summarize, represent, and interpret data on two quantitative variables
    description: This standard covers the representation and interpretation of data on two quantitative variables.
    objectives:
      0: Represent data on two quantitative variables on a scatter plot, and describe how the variables are related.
      1: Fit a function to the data; use functions fitted to data to solve problems in the context of the data. Use given functions or choose a function suggested by the context. Emphasize linear, quadratic, and exponential models.
      2: Informally assess the fit of a function by plotting and analyzing residuals.
      3: Fit a linear function for a scatter plot that suggests a linear association.
  linear-models:
    name: Interpret linear models
    description: This standard covers the computation and interpretation of linear models, and the interpretation of the coefficients and goodness of fit of a linear fit.
    objectives:
      0: Compute and interpret the coefficients of a linear fit.
      1: Compute and interpret goodness of fit of a linear fit.
