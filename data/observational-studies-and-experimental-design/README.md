  take-random-samples:
    name: Evaluate random processes underlying statistical experiments
    description: This standard covers the ability to inferences and justify conclusions from sample surveys, experiments, and observational studies.
    objectives:
      0: Select random samples from data
      1: Evaluate the statistical significance of your results based on sample size
      2: Compare results from different random sample populations to evaluate a model's effectiveness
  make-justified-conclusions:
    name: Make inferences and justify conclusions from sample surveys, experiments, and observational studies
    description: This standard covers the ability to inferences and justify conclusions from sample surveys, experiments, and observational studies.
    objectives:
      0: Recognize the purposes of and differences among sample surveys, experiments, and observational studies; explain how randomization relates to each.
      1: Use data from a sample survey to estimate a population mean or proportion; develop a margin of error.
      2: Use data from a randomized experiment to compare two treatments; decide if differences between parameters are significant.
      3: Distinguish correlation and causation
