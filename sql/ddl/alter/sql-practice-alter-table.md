# SQL Practice Aggregate Average

---        
## Exercise

Consider the `item_pictures` table. When we originally created the schema, we made the length far too short!  
Unfortunately, the schema is already in production, so we can't drop the database and re-create it.  
Write a statement to modify the `item_pictures` table to adapt to the problem presented.  
Don't directly edit the tables, use a statement to change the tables.  
To submit, run your SQL and then add the link from SQLFiddle to your submission.
