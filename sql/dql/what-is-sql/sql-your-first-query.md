```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

This code retrieves **all** the data from the `users` table. It's often used to inspect what's inside a database.

> If you like, type and run the code above in the code playground that's in the Learn More link below.

From the next workout, things will get exciting! Pretty much all the insights will teach you how to **build more complicated and useful queries**.
