# How to use SQL?

---
## Content

OK, now you know what SQL is, and why you need it. So how do we get started?

In terms of setup, there isn't a universal program or app that you install. Different databases have different connection methods.

As you make progress, some of the Learn More links will show you how connect to the different databases, alongside playgrounds[1] for writing code.

> Note: over time, quite a few *flavors*[2], of SQL were created. But the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) has adopted SQL as a standard since 1986. 

> This means that any code written in ANSI should work with any flavor. So for the rest of this course, we'll teach you the ANSI Standard SQL. 

Enough talk! In the next insight you'll write your first query.

## Footnotes

[1:Playgrounds]
Within some of the Learn More links, we'll provide you with URLs, so that you can test the code yourself, or even experiment. We'll also teach you how to connect to different databases, so that you can apply what you're learning in practice.

[2:SQL Flavours]
From the ANSI standard, a handful of branches blossomed. Here are the most popular ones, in no particular order:
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Oracle
- Microsoft SQL

Each of these extensions can include additional functionality, but any code written with the ANSI Standard in mind should also work.
