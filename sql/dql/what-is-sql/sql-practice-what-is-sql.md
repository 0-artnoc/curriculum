## Exercise

Follow the link above to SQLFiddle. Run **Build Schema**. This creates and populates a simple user management database.

Next, click **Run SQL** and observe the output.

Now, alter the query (in the right-hand window) to return one `email` address instead of returning one `name`.

Click **Run SQL** again. Then click **link** in the green bar below the output. This will update the URL in the address bar of your browser. Copy the new URL and paste it into the answer field below.
