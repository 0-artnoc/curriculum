# SQL Practice What is SQL

## Exercise

_________________________________

Follow the link below to SQLFiddle. Run *Build Schema*. This creates and populates a simple user management database.

Next, click *Run SQL* and observe the output.

Now, alter the query (in the right-hand window) to return one `email` address instead of returning one `name`.

Click *Run SQL* again. Then click *link* in the green bar below the output. This will update the URL in the address bar of your browser. Copy the new URL to submit with your answer.

In the answer field, enter the email address that was returned.
