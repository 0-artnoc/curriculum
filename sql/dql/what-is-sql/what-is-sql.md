# What is SQL?

---
## Content

**SQL** stands for **Structured Query Language**. 

It's a programming language that lets you get data from a database[1]. 

You use *queries* to get the data. Here's an example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

The query above returns all the rows and columns from the `users` table.

Next let's go over why SQL is such an important skill to learn!
