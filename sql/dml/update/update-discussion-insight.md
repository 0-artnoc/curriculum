Let's see how you can handle manipulating data!

Consider the following table `movies` table:

| id | name                                     | year | rating |
|----|------------------------------------------|------|--------|
| 1  | Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban | 2004 | 9.5    |

How would you update the record with `id = 1`?

It's up to you to choose which movie you'll update it too and the rating that you're going to give it.

To achieve this, you should use the following concepts:
- updating data (`UPDATE ... SET ... WHERE ...`)

If you're not sure what to do, check out this footnote[1].

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

To update the values in a table, start by writing `UPDATE table_name`.

Then, using the `SET` keyword you can change the values found in columns.

Finally, use the `WHERE` keyword to specify which records should be updated:

```sql
UPDATE movies
SET
  name = "My Movie",
  year = 2020,
  rating = 7
WHERE
  id = 1;
```
