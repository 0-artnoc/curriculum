# INSERT

---

## Content

Adding new data into your table is as simple as writing `INSERT INTO table VALUES`.

Consider the following `fruits` table:

| id | name      |
|----|-----------|
| 1  | Raspberry |

To add a new fruit, you'd write:

```sql
INSERT INTO fruits VALUES
(2, 'Pineapple');
```

Now, return all the values[1] in the `fruits` table and you'll get:

| id | name      |
|----|-----------|
| 1  | Raspberry |
| 2  | Pineapple |


> ðŸ’¡ This is a short introduction to the `INSERT` keyword. We'll explain how everything works in the next workout.
