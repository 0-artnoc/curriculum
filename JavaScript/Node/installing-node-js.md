## Content

To setup a local environment to use Node.js both a text editor and the Node.js binary installables are required. JavaScript files can be created in any text editor, for example Notepad provided the file has the extension `.js` , however it’s recommended to use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Atom which is a far more useful tool when programming.

The latest version of Node is available to download from the Node website, once this has been downloaded and extracted, Node can be tested to ensure it’s working:
```
$node
>
```
If the `>`  symbol appears after the `node` command has been run then the installation of Node was successful.
