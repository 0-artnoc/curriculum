## Content

A module encapsulates an amount of code into one single code unit. Node has a module system implemented which allows for other open-source JavaScript files to be included and used in your application. A substantial amount of Nodeâ€™s core functionality was implemented using JavaScript modules.

Node incorporates 3 different module types, modules can either be core modules, local modules or third party modules. An example of a core Node module is the `http` module.

Using modules when building Node applications give a number of advantages:

- inclusion of external libraries
- increased organization of code parts
- reducing the amount of code per file
- easier to read and maintain code
