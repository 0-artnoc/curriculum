## Content

Node.js is an extremely powerful JavaScript framework which was built upon Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. It provides an asynchronous, event driven, I/O based cross-platform runtime environment for the development of server-side JavaScript applications.

It can be used to build a variety of applications including single and multi-page web applications, real-time chat applications, command line applications and more. There are a number of advantages associated with Node.js:

- It is free to download and to use and allows entire server side applications to be built only using JavaScript.
- Due to Node.js being a lightweight framework it includes the bare minimum number of required modules, consequently improving running speeds and performance. It allows for other modules to be included when required by the application being built.
- Node performs faster than other frameworks because it’s asynchronous by default.
- It’s a cross-platform framework which runs on Windows, Mac and Linux.
