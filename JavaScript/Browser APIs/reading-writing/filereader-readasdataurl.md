## Content

The `readAsDataURL()` method is used with file or blob objects. When the read operation is complete it returns a *data URL* with the files contents as base 64 encoded string.

This functionality is often used to create thumbnail previews of uploaded image files.

Creating a new instance of File Reader.
```JavaScript
var reader = new FileReader();
```
Reading the data URL.
``` JavaScript
reader.onload = function(e) {
  var dataURL = reader.result;
}
reader.readAsDataURL(file);
```

Here, the variable `e` stands for `Event`, which is an interface that represents any event that takes place in the DOM (Document Object Model). Some of these events are user generated (e.g. keyboard or mouse events), whilst others are generated by some APIs (e.g. when a video is paused or when all updates have been installed).
