 ## Content

There are several options when it comes to JavaScript package managers.

The oldest one, **npm**, started off as the package manager for *node*. However, it transitioned to hosting both front-end and back-end, which means not having to use multiple package managers.

**Bower** used to solve the problem *npm* had: missing browser/front-end support. Nowadays, this is not the case anymore.

Another option is **duo**. It uses `require()` statements inside the JavaScript files to look and download packages. The disadvantage of using *duo* is requiring the same package in multiple places: you would have to update multiple statements to change the package version.

Out of these three, **npm** sticks out as being the *"package manager for JavaScript"*. Right now, there is no reason not to use npm.
