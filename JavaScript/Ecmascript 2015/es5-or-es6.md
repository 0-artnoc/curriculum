The falling blocks will belong to the
`ES5` or `ES6` iteration of Ecmascript.

Categorize them into the correct version
of Ecmascript before they reach the ground.

ES5:ES6

```false
class
%exp
Classes are, in fact, "special functions”
and they are formed of two main parts:
class declaration and class expression.
They were introduced with ES6.
%

extends
%exp
The JS pattern of simulating class-like
inheritance has been formalized as now it
is offering a convenient declarative form
for class pattern. It can be used in ES
since version 6.
%

{[v]:1}
%exp
This syntax enables users to assign values
to variables declared. It has been
introduced to ES since version 6.
%

`Hello ${name}`
%exp
Template strings provide syntactic sugar
for constructing strings. The first version
of ES to support this was ES6.
%

var [a,b] = [1,2]
%exp
Destructing allows users to extract data
from objects or arrays intro distinct
variables. ES6 was the first version
to have it implemented.
%

const
%exp
If a variable is defined as const it will
always hold the same value as it has been
initially assigned. It has been introduced
since version 6.
%

let
%exp
`let` defines a block scope variable. ES6
is the first version of Ecmascript to have
it implemented.
%

function f(x, y=12)
%exp
A feature that has been introduced since
ES6 is assigning a default value to
a parameter.
%

(x) => {return x;}
%exp
Arrow functions are basically function
expressions in a more concise manner.
ES introduced arrow functions since ES6.
%

function* ()
%exp
Another feature introduced in ES6 are
anonymous function, that means functions
without a name.
%

{v}
%exp
In ES6 objects are created using `{v}`
syntax.
%

Promise
%exp
Promise objects are used for asynchronous
computations. Ecmascript supports this
type of object since ES6.
%

Proxy
%exp
A type of object introduced in ES6.
It enables us to trap or intercept all of
the operations on a target object and
modify how this target operates.
%

for (x of object)
%exp
Iterator objects enable custom iteration
like Java Iterable. It can be used in
Ecmascript since version 6.
%

Object.assign
%exp
The Object.assign() method is used to copy
the values of properties from one or more
source objects to a target object. It is
supported since version 6.
%

Object.observe
%exp
The Object.observe() method is used for
asynchronously observing the changes
to an object. Ecmascript supports
this method since version 6.
%

Object.freeze
%exp
Prevents new properties from being added
to the object; prevents existing
properties from being removed; and
prevents existing properties from being
changed. ES supports this method
since version 5.
%

```

```true

undefined
%exp
In ES5 variables which have never been
assigned a value are `undefined`
variables.
%

Array
%exp
The JavaScript `Array` object is used
in the construction of arrays. Ecmascript
supports this object since version 5.
%

Number
%exp
In ES5 the `number` object represents a
set of all possible integer values
including the special “Not-a-Number”
(NaN) values, positive infinity and
negative infinity.
%

var
%exp
ES5 has implemented `var`, which enables
users to declare a variable of any type.
%

null
%exp
The first version to support `null` is
ES5.
%

if (key in object)
%exp
The in operator matches all object keys,
including those in the object's prototype
chain. The first Ecmascript version to
support this feature is ES5.
%

Math.PI
%exp
This is a new library which comes in hand
when more complex calculations are needed.
It is supported since ES5.
%

void
%exp
A void function is a function that has no
return values. It is supported since ES5.
%

typeof
%exp
Returns the type of the checked object.
Ecmascript supports it since ES5.
%

instanceof
%exp
Returns the instance of the checked
object. ES5 was the first version to
support it.
%

```
