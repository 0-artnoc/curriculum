With access to literals and replacement values you can use Tagged Template Literals to perform additional processing logic on a string and even replace the string entirely - for example:

```
function myFunc(strings, sub){
 return "Goodbye " + sub; 
} 

myFunc `Hello ${company} hows it going?`
// "Goodbye Enki"
```

Probably a better approach is to use the **rest** operator to map values to an array rather than define each argument:

```
function myFunc(strings, â€¦values){
...
}
```
