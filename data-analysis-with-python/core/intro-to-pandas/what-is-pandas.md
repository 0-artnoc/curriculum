`pandas` is an open-source data manipulation tool. It is fast, powerful, and flexible.

`pandas` is built on `numpy`.

It offers an efficient `DataFrame` object used for data manipulation.

It offers tools for large data sets and provides flexibility:
- merging
- sorting
- reshaping
- pivoting
- slicing
- indexing
- subsetting
- joining
- and more

With `pandas` you can also highlight columns and rows in `DataFrame` objects.

There are many more features that we will use and mention later on.
