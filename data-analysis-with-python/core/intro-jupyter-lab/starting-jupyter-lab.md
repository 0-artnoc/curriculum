# Starting Jupyter Lab 

---
## Content

After installing the Jupyter lab, you will get a message saying:

"To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:"

And a file path to the file will be displayed under it. Either copy the file path or locate the file and drag and drop it to a browser to open the Jupyter lab.

After opening it, you will be greeted with a screen like this one:

[jupyter-lab-first-start](https://img.enkipro.com/ac3ba36012122827477887b580257f4d.png)

> You may have to copy the file path only the first time. Every next time you open jupyter lab with the `jupyter-lab` command, jupyter will open in your default browser.

On the left-hand side, you will have some files. You can ignore these for now and look at the right-hand side instead.

On the right-hand side, you will have the launcher.

The launcher has three sections:
- Notebook
- Console
- Other

The first section has the option to create a new Python 3 Notebook (which includes IPython).

The second section has the option to only create an interactive IPython console.

The last section has four options:
- basic terminal
- text file
- markdown file
- Show Contextual Help

The first three create different files while the fourth option is used to check the documentation for specific functions.

The launcher is located in the `File` tab in the `menu` bar.
