# How to Install & Run Jupyter

---
## Content

You can install Jupyter through `conda` or `pip`.

> 💡 Along with Jupyter we will also install the IPython shell that we discussed in a previous workout.

Installing through Anaconda:
```sh
conda install jupyter ipython
```

> 💡 When installing through `pip` you first have to make sure `pip` is upgraded to the latest version.

Installing through `pip`:
```python
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade jupyter ipython
```

To run Jupyter type this in your command prompt/terminal:
```sh
jupyter-lab
```
