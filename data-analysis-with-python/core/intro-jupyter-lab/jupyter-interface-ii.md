## Content

Previously we have discussed what the first tab of Jupyter Lab is. Now we will discuss the remaining ones.

After `File Browser`, we have the `Running Terminals & Kernels` tab. This tab will be empty when you first open it.

It will contain every active Kernel and Terminal in your Notebook.

Here is how it would look like if we had some kernels and terminals:

> ❗️ If you have a running notebook and/or terminal, clicking `x` will not stop the kernel/terminal, it will only close the viewing tab.

Here is an example:

The next tab is called `Commands`.

We won't be diving into this tab in this insight because there is too much unnecessary information for a beginner.

Essentially this tab contains all the commands Jupyter lab has to offer.

After that, we have the `Property Inspector` tab.

In this tab, you can add properties for your widgets. We will discuss this later if and when we add widgets to our notebooks.

The last two tabs are the `Open Tabs` and `Extension Manager`.

`Open Tabs` shows a list of all currently open tabs.

The `Extension Manager` is used to integrate a third-party app from the community.

This tab is useful but can be "dangerous" at times. This is because the Jupyter team doesn't personally check each and every app. There is a chance that someone might try to insert some malicious code into your computer.

## Practice

Match the definition to the `tab` its related to.

Contains all available commands = ???
View running notebooks ???
View all files = ???
Integrate apps = ???
View open tabs = ???
Modify widgets = ???


- Commands
- Running Terminals & Kernels
- File Browser
- Extension Manager
- Open Tabs
- Property Inspector

## Revision

The ??? tab is used to create a new Launcher, a new folder, navigate, and upload files.

- File browser
- Open tabs
- Current files
- Running Terminals % Kernels
