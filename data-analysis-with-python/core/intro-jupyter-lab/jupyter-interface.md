# Jupyter Lab Interface

---
## Content

In the previous insight, we have told you to ignore the left-hand-side for now.

What you saw in that image is the `File Browser`.

Next to the `File Browser`, the left side of Jupyter lab contains 5 more tabs.

From top-to-bottom these six tabs are:
- File Browser
- Running Terminals & Kernels
- Commands
- Property Inspector
- Open Tabs
- Extension Manager

The `File Browser` has four buttons:
- New Launcher
- New Folder
- Upload
- Refresh List

It is used to access files.

> The Jupyter Lab has access to the startup folder where it was installed as well as any subfolder.

We will use the `File Browser` to create a new folder.

While the tab is selected, click on this button:

[file-browser-new-folder](https://img.enkipro.com/da37c0ee3805f6f3d06543e7c119c513.png)

This will create a new folder. We will name it "Python Testing".

> All of our future notebooks will go into this folder.

The other three buttons on this tab are:

[file-browser-buttons](https://img.enkipro.com/3113de39f9461b60d8b738991f0c54c0.png)

> We will discuss the rest of the features in the next insight.
