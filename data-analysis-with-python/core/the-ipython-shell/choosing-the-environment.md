# Choosing the Right Environment

---
## Content

When it comes to coding in Python, there are several environments you can choose from.

For instance, the most basic environment you can write Python is in your OS's terminal. 

You can write and test code here by first initializing the interpreter(ADD GLOSSARY ENTRY HERE) by typing `python` in your terminal.

However, this is not the recommended way because there are far superior environments with better interpreters for coding in Python.

Some of these are:
- Jupyter Lab
- IDLE
- nteract
- PyScripter
- IPython
- and many more

In this course, we will be using Jupyter Lab along with Ipython.
