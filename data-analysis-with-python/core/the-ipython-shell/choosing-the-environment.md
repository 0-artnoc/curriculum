# Choosing the Right Environment

---
## Content

When it comes to coding in Python, there are several environments you can choose from.

For instance, the most basic ones are the built-in terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (windows).

You can run Python in all of them.

However, this is not the recommended way because there are far superior environments for coding in Python.

Some of these are:
- IDLE,
- nteract,
- PyScripter,
- IPython,
- and many more

In this course, we will be using the Jupyter Lab application along with the IPython shell.
