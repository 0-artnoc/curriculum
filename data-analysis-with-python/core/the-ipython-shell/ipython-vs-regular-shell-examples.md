# IPython vs Terminal vs Command Prompt

---
## Content

In this insight, we will show you the same piece of code ran on Python's basic interpreter vs the IPython shell.

> 💡 IPython can be used on any operating system and can be launched through any OS terminal (after installation).

Here is the piece of code we will test:
```python
num1 = 4.5
num2 = 1.3
num3 = 5.3

sum = num1 + num2 + num3

print('The sum of {0}, {1}, and {2} is {3}'.format(num1, num2, num3, sum))
```

Running this code on Pythons interpreter:

Running it on IPython:

As you can see, there are some clear differences between the two.

Ipython offers color coding, multi-line editing, line numbering, and more.

## Practice

Doing which of these does not require an alternate Python interpreter to run Python code?

???

- Mathematical operations
- Multi-line editing
- syntax highlighting
- tab completion

## Revision

Python code can only run on basic terminals?

???

- False
- True

### Explanations

1) Correct. Python can be run on any utility that has support for Python code. Basic terminals, IPython, Anaconda, and more.
2) Incorrect. Python can be run on any utility that has support for Python code. Basic terminals, IPython, Anaconda, and more.
