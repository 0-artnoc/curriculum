# IPython vs Terminal vs Command Prompt

---
## Content

In this insight, we will show you the same piece of code ran on windows 10 command prompt, Mac/Linux, and IPython (also on Windows).

> 💡 IPython can be used on any operating system. However, we will be using it on Windows in this course.

Here is the piece of code we will test:
```python
num1 = 4.5
num2 = 1.3
num3 = 5.3

sum = num1 + num2 + num3

print('The sum of {0}, {1}, and {2} is {3}'.format(num1, num2, num3, sum))
```

Running this code on Windows 10 CMD:

> Since Linux and Mac both use the Terminal and are the same, we will only show you the Linux one.

Running it on Mac/Linux Terminal:

Running it on IPython (Windows):

As you can see, coding in the basic environment is the same both on Windows and Linux/Mac, however, when you look at IPython you can clearly see some differences.

Lastly, here is an example of the same code running on Jupyter with IPython:

## Practice

Python code can only run on basic terminals?
