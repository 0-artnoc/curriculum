## Content

First off for this course, you will need to install Python. Next, you will also need the Jupyter Lab.

> There are several ways of installing both Python and the Jupyter Lab.

First, we need to install Python.

To do that we need to go to Python's website and choose a version.

Then download the executable for the version you've selected and run it.

After running it, if you are new, always select the recommended settings. Also, make sure `Pip` is installed! 

> 💡 `Pip` is a package manager for Python.

As the last step, to make sure everything installed properly, you should run the `Python -V` and `pip -V` commands through a command prompt/terminal to see if they were installed and to confirm their versions.
