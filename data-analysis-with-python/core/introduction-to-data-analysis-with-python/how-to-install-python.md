# How to Install Python

---
## Content

First off for this course, you will need to install Python. Other than that, you will also need the Jupyter Lab.

> There are several ways of installing both Python and the Jupyter Lab.

First, we need to install Python.

To do that we need to go to Python's website and choose the latest stable version.

Then download the executable for the version you've selected and run it.

After running it, if you are new, always select the recommended settings. Also, make sure `pip` is installed! 

When installing, there will be a checkmark box for `pip`. Make sure it is selected.

> 💡 `pip` is a package manager for Python.

As the last step, to make sure everything installed properly, you should run the `python -V` and `pip -V` commands through a command prompt/terminal to see if they were installed and to confirm their versions.

> To start coding Python in your terminal, you first have to launch the interpreter.

You do so by typing `python` in your terminal.
