# Intro to Data Analysis

## Content

Data analysis is the process of analyzing and discovering useful information from a collection of data.

Data analysis has a handful of steps:

- Figure out which data you need.
- Decide how you want to measure and gather your data
- After collecting the data, you can use different tools to spot patterns
- Analyze/conclude your findings
- Communicate/share the findings

A real-life example of the above process in a company could be:

- I want to find which employees have worked for more than 10 years at my company as well as who has worked the most hours.

This means gathering all the workers' information, dates they have started working on as well as the hours they have put in.

- We want to measure hours put in from the beginning of their employment.

This means we need the exact date they started to work and the exact number of hours they punched in.

- Then, we have different tools we can use to spot patterns. 

Since we are only looking at two columns with raw numbers/values, we don't need any tool to analyze this. We can just sort the values and determine who has the most hours and who has worked the longest.

- Analyze/conclude. 

John has worked for the company for 31 years and has clocked in around 62880 hours of work.

- Communicate/share findings

Dear John, since you've worked the longest and hardest at this company, you will be awarded a raise and a brand new company car!!
