In this course, you will learn how to analyze data with Python.

For a better understanding, you can complete the first few workouts of our *Data Analysis* topic to get a better understanding of what it is.

Also, as to not repeat information, if you have never done any Python, you should start with the **Core** course of the **Python** topic.
