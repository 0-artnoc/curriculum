# What is matplotlib?

## Content

`matplotlib` is an open-source visualization library for Python.

With `matplotlib` you can create numerous animated, static, or interactive visualizations.

You can create pie, polar, line, bar, and column charts. You can also create polygons, gradients, subplots, axes, texts, labels, annotations, arrows, ellipses, 3-Dimensional plotting, and many more things.

This library also supports `event handling`.

Here are some events:
- button_press_event
- close_event
- key_press_event
- key_release_event
- scroll_event
- etc

What we have above, are `event names`. When one of these events is triggered, for instance, the `key_release_event`, a class instance is sent. In this case, the instance is `MouseEvent`.

You can set up an outcome for any of these events.

We will discuss these events when we use them later on.
