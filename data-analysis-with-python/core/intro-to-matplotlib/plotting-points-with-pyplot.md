# Plotting points with pyplot

---
## Content

The `pyplot` library contains a function called `.plot`. You can use this function to plot the axis.

When you plot with this function a PNG image is created with the selected plot points and printed in the output.

Ploting the `x` axis:

> As you can see in the example above, `plotly` assumes we have added the `y` axis values and it generates the `x` axis values on its own.

We have added an array of values from `1` to `3`. Whereas `pyplot` generated the same number of values but from `0` to `2`.

To avoid auto-generated plot points, you would have to add another set of values separated with a comma:

![same-axis-pyplot](https://img.enkipro.com/9183f651d18f99876061978fdf474217.png)

Now both axes are generated by us.

Here is another example with different plot points:

Next, to generating an axis, we can add and customize labels.
