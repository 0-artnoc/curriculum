`pyplot` is a collection of functions built into `matplotlib` that makes `matplotlib` operate like MATLAB.

You can use `pyplot` functions to:
- create figures
- plot lines
- plot areas in a figure
- add and decorate labels
- and more

> We will give different examples in the next insight.

To use `pyplot` we will first have to import it from the `matplotlib` library.

To do so only once, go to your `startup.py` file and add this bellow the imports:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

This way, we can use `pyplot` through the `plt` keyword.

If you don't want to add it to your `startup.py` file, you can import it into every console/terminal/notebook when you want to use it.
