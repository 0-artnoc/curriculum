# The pyplot.plot function

---
## Content

The `pyplot` library contains a function called `.plot`. You can use this function to plot an axis.

When you plot with this function a figure/image is created with the selected axis and/or markers and printed in the output.

Here is the full syntax for the `.plot` function:
```python
plot([x], y, [fmt], *, data=None, **kwargs)
```

You can add as many x,y and fmt values as you want:

```python
plot([x], y, [fmt], [x2], y2, [fmt2], ..., **kwargs)
```

Only the `y` value is mandatory. The `x` value, `fmt`, and others are all optional.

The `y` values represent the vertical axis while the `x` values represent the horizontal axis.

> For now we will use the `y,x` values. We will add markers and modify our plot in the next insight.

Adding the `y` axis:

> By default, when you add any axis without a specific line style, a line drawn.

> As you can see in the example above, `pyplot` assumes we have added the `y` axis values and it generates the `x` axis values on its own.

We have added an array of values from `1` to `3`. Whereas `pyplot` generated the same number of values but from `0` to `2`.

To avoid auto-generated plot points, you would have to add another set of values separated with a comma:

![same-axis-pyplot](https://img.enkipro.com/9183f651d18f99876061978fdf474217.png)

Now both axes are generated by us.

Here is another example with different plot points:

Next, to generating an axis, we can add and customize labels.

## Practice

`matplotlib.pyplot.plot` function ???

- creates a PNG output of the provided code
- creates a GIF output from an external link

---
## Revision

If you only add the values for the `y` axis of a `pyplot` plot, what would happen?

`pyplot` will ???

- generate the x-axis with values on its own.
- create an image with only the y-axis values.
