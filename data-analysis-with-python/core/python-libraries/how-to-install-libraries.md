> Before importing libraries in Python, you will have to install them. 

There are two ways you can install libraries in Python:
- Through `pip`
- Through `conda`

We will be using `pip` because we have already installed it when we installed Python. 

To install libraries through `pip`:

```python
pip install "library name"
```

For instance:
```python 
pip install pandas
```

However, if you are going to use `Anaconda` to install libraries you can do so like this:

```python
conda install "Library name"
```

For instance:

```
conda install numpy
```
