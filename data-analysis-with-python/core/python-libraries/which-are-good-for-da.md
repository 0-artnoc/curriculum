# Which Python Libraries Are Good For Data Analysis?

---
## Content

Python has tons of community-driven libraries. These libraries can be used for many different things.

Some can be specific to arrays, others specific to dictionaries, some are good at visualization, others at plotting points, etc.

Here are some famous libraries for data analysis:
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- scipy
- plotly
- seaborn
- scikit learn

The `matplotlib` library is a famous visualization library. It provides the ability to plot points to form different static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

The `numpy` library provides support for N-Dimensional arrays. It also provides mathematical functions, algebra routines, and more.

The `pandas` library provides fast and flexible tools for easier and faster data analysis in Python.

The `scipy` library provides user-friendly numerical routines for integration, interpolation, optimization, and more.

The `plotly` library is a graphic library. It provides the ability to import, copy and paste, analyze and/or visualize data. It also provides a GUI and the ability to share your work via a URL.

The `seaborn` library is used for data visualization. This library was based on `matplotlib` and provides a way to draw attractive and informative statistical graphs.

The `scikit` library provides efficient tools for predictive data analysis. This library was built on `numpy`, `matlpotlib`, and `scipy`.

> All of the above libraries are open source and free to install and use.

In this course, we will be using the `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `pandas` libraries.
