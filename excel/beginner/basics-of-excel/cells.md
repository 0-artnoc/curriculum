# What is a cell?

## Content

A cell in Excel is where a row and a column intersect.

Since each row has a number, and each column has a letter, each cell corresponds to a letter-number combination. This combination is called a cells `address`.

Every sheet starts with an `A1` cell at the top left corner.

Cells are essentially storage units that can contain numbers, text, formulas, dates and more.

There are 4 types of cells in Excel:
1. Numbers(Formulas, Dates and Times)
2. Strings
3. Boolean
4. Error()

Each cell can be a different size and be formatted independently from other cells.

When a new sheet is created blank, all cells have equal sizes. However, they can be resized at any time.

For instance, if a cell contains a date, it can have different formatting like in the example below:
