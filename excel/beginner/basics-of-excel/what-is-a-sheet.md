# What is Sheet?

## Content

A Sheet or a Worksheet in Excel is a single page(sheet) of a Workbook/Spreadsheet/file.

It consists of rows usually marked with numbers and columns usually marked with letters.

The maximum number of rows, columns, and cells a sheet can have, solely depends on the version of Excel.

For instance, a Google docs sheet can have a maximum of 500,000 rows, 18,278 columns or 5,000,000 cells. As soon as the cell count reaches 5milion, you cannot make any more new rows or columns.

To add a new sheet in Google docs, go to the bottom left corner of the spreadsheet and press on the `+` sign.
The process is the same for Microsoft Excel.

Right-clicking a sheet opens a menu where you can rename it, move it, duplicate, delete and more.
