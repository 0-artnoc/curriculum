# What I Need To Use Excel

---
## Content

There are 3 ways of using excel.

First, Google Sheets,(https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/) which is completely free and all you need is a free Gmail account.

The 2nd and 3rd are Microsofts versions of excel.

Microsoft Excel is a part of its "office 365" pack of software and has a subscription-based version that requires a monthly fee or a one time fee.

The monthly fee versions include Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Publisher and Access software with the addition of One drive and Skype. 

The personal one is for one person on an unlimited number of devices, Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iPhone. 

Whereas the one time fee version is meant for a single student and only includes Word, Excel, and PowerPoint and is much cheaper.

Some versions of Office include an offline version of these programs, more info on(https://products.office.com/en/buy/office?market=af).
