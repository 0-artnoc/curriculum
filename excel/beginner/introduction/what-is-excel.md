## Content

Excel is a spreadsheet program used for recording, analyzing and calculating numerical data. 

It is made up of rows and columns of cells that form a table. 

A cell is an intersection between a column and a row.

Rows are marked with numbers(starting from 1), columns are marked with letters(starting from A) and each cell can be referenced with its letter-number pair(starting from A1).
