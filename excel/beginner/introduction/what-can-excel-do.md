# What can you do with excel

## Content

Excel is great with numerical data. 

You can use it for simple or complex mathematical calculations.

A simple calculation is using any one formula: Addition/subtraction/multiplication... 

A complex calculation is using 2 or more formulas at the same time.

You can use Excel to create Graphs and Charts to better represent the inputted data.

You can make Pivot tables, which are one of Excel's most powerful features. These tables let you extract an important part of the whole data to represent it more clearly.

Furthermore, Excel can be used to calculate averages, medians or date calculations.

There are many formulas that can be used to easily organize and look/calculate only specific data from the spreadsheet. You can set up formulas to change the color of certain cells based on calculations or if a condition is met. 

There is also some more advanced stuff Excel can do, which we will discuss later on.
