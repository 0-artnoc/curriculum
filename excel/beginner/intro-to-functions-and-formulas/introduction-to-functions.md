# Introduction to functions

---
## Content

Functions are predefined formulas.

The best part is, there are tons of built-in functions in Excel.

This is why you don't need to create formulas for most things, you can just make use of Excel's built-in ones.

These functions can be used to calculate a sum, an average, min and max values, perform a count, calculate logarithms and much more. A full list of built-in functions will be in the `links` sections.

Just like formulas, functions start with an equal sign but are followed by a "function name" and an argument.

All functions are written in UPPERCASE letters.

For instance, `=SUM(B2:B3)` would sum all values from cell B2 to B3.

Functions can also input multiple arguments.

Example:
```
=MAX(A1:A3,B2:B3,E7)
```
