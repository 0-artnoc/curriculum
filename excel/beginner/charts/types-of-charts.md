Some of the more well known ones are the `Pie`, `Bar` and `Columns` charts.

### The `Pie` Chart
-------------------------------

The pie chart is circular and sliced into sections like a pie. The whole Pie represents 100% and each section is a percentage of the whole pie.

Example chart which shows the total number of users for the first 10 days of December for a certain app.
