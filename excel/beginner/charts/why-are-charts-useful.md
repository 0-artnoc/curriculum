# Why are charts useful?

---
## Content

A good example of why charts are useful is because they can be used to detect patterns and understand results in a more clear way.

They are good for understanding large quantities of data with ease and speed.

A single chart can easily represent thousands of data.

Each type of chart also "tells a story".

This is because upon creating a chart with large data, you can instantly see patterns and visualize the data and use it to determine any negative or positive information regarding the data.
