# Airtable?

---
## Content

Part database, part spreadsheet, Airtable was introduced in 2012 and has since continued to grow.

Airtable can be used as a simple spreadsheet, but most of its power comes from the ability to introduce multiple data types in a cell (e.g. documents, images etc.), especially when compared to other spreadsheet applications (such as Excel or Google Sheets). You can say that Airtable was designed for data entry.

Another advantage that Airtable has over traditional spreadsheets is that you can group rows by their values and link different data tables together.

Airtable can be used as a personal spreadsheet, for a small project, or even as a production database for your application.
