# Common Terminology

## Content

Before you start working with Airtable, it might be worth it to go through some of the most common terminology.

Let's start off with some common spreadsheet terms:
- cell
  - it is a rectangle in which you insert data
- column
  - vertical cells
- row
  - horizontal cells

And now, some Airtable specific terms:
- workspace
  - you can think of a workspace as a collection of your projects
  - for example, you can have a workspace for your taxes and different one for your application
  - workspaces help you separate concerns
- table
  - a table is comprised of cells, rows and columns
  - think of a table as a spreadsheet
- base
  - as you might've already guessed, base comes from database
  - a database can have multiple tables
  - think of a base as a worksheet in Excel/Google Sheets

Now that you have an account and you have familiarized yourself with the terminology, you are ready to start working with Airtable.
