# Filtering Data

---
## Content

Creating new views can prove useful in many scenarios, but Airtable is not limited to that. Another important feature is the possibility to the filter data (depending on predefined criteria) that you can see.

Filters do not change the data in the table, they simply hide some of the records.

A filter can be applied to any field, and depending on the field, it can have different options. Here are some filter examples, grouped by field type:
- Text fields
  - Field contains/doesn't contain the inputted text
  - Field is/isn't the same as the inputted text
  - Field is/isn't empty
- Single select
  - Field is/isn't the same as the inputted option
  - Field is any of the inputted options
- Numbers
  - Field is/isn't the inputted number
  - Field is greater/lower than the inputted number

Filters are not limited to these field types, the above represent an example meant to point out the power of filters.

Filters can be used to create new views, or they can be applied to already created views. It is up to you how you use them.
