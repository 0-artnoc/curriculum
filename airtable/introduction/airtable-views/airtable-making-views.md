# Making Views

---
## Content

Consider that you are trying to create a new product, and would like to do a market research. This would include sending out forms for users to fill in and further analyzing the gathered data.

In Airtable, you can create a Form view, which can be sent to your users to complete. Each completion is recorded in the table, and it can be seen in the main view.

To begin, create a new table which you can name however you want (we chose `Market Research`). In the table, each field will represent an entry that the user will have to fill in. You can start off with something simple, like this:
- `Full Name` - Single line text
- `Do you enjoy our product?` - Single select
- `Suggestions for improvement` - Long text
- `Rating` - Rating

We have also removed all the empty records (that come by default when creating a new table). Your table should now look something like this:

To create a new view, click on the `Grid view` button (seen in the top left corner of the example) and multiple options will be presented to you. Continue by clicking on `Form` and you are ready.

There you have it, your form is ready.
