# Importing Data

---
## Content

In Airtable, there are three main ways of creating a base:
- From a template
- From a spreadsheet
- From scratch

We have previously discussed the first method, and now we will take a look at importing data. Imagine that you are a scientist researching and developing a drone that is meant to fly on Mars. Using a formula you were able to create a `.csv`[1] file and you would like to have all this data in Airtable.

The long way around is to manually insert all the records, but that is not the only way. What you can do, when clicking on the `'Add a base'` button, is select the option that says `'Import a spreadsheet'` and upload the `.csv` file that you already had. At the end, you will be prompted for the base name, color and other initial information.

In the example, we chose to upload a `.csv` file from our own computer. Some other upload options include:
- pasting table date (e.g. from Excel or Google Sheets)
- upload a `.csv` file from a URL
- upload a `.csv` file from an online storage option
  - some options include Google Drive, Dropbox, and One Drive

## Footnotes

[1:CSV]
The `.csv` extension stands for **Comma Separated Values**, a file type which is used to store data sets in plain sets. Each column is separated by a comma, and each new line represents a new row.
