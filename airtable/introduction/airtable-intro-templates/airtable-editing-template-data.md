# Editing Template Data

---
## Content

Without going into too much detail, let's see how you would go about editing the imported template.

Let's take a look at the template:

![first-look-at-base](https://img.enkipro.com/145c0efb5e31f11c47c9b386e5d5bda8.png)

From the image above you can deduce that the base is named `'Apartment Hunting'`, and it contains two tables, `'Apartments'` and `'Districts'`, along with the sample records previously mentioned.

If you don't like the name `'Apartment Hunting'`, or you would simply like to change it, just click on it and a pop-up with several options will appear. In there, you can choose to change the base's name, color, icon, and description (there are several other options there which are not relevant for this insight).

Here is how we have changed some of the settings mentioned above:

![airtable-change-name-color-icon](https://img.enkipro.com/5d8193658aa22bd5539243bf737ada7b.gif)

The same process can be applied to tables and columns, and in this way you can fully customize the template to fit your requirements.
