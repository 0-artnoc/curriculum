# What Are Templates?

---
## Content

Whether you are just starting out, you are not sure what Airtable is capable of, or just looking to explore, it is a good idea to check the available templates.

A template is a base that has already been created with a specific purpose in mind. They help you get started quick, and if your requirements change along the way you can always update the base.

For exploration purposes, the [templates page](https://airtable.com/templates) allows you to search directly by name or by choosing a category.

Some template examples include:
- [Project planning with Gantt](https://airtable.com/templates/project-management/exptRCzoncS1Sjsf0/project-planning-with-gantt)
- [Content calendar](https://airtable.com/templates/featured/exp3FNmOkdHZvprXB/content-calendar)
- [User research](https://airtable.com/templates/featured/expwA47rLvwTu3SiF/user-research)
- many others...
