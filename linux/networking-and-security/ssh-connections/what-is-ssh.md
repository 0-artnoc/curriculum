# What is SSH?


---

## Content

SSH, the acronym for *Secure Socket Shell*, is a protocol that provides a safe way of accessing *remote systems*. It can be seen as a more secure version of Telnet, by ensuring *strong authentication* and *secure encrypted data transfer* between two computers over a possible insecure Internet connection.

An SSH connection can be established through the use of the following 3 utilities:

- `ssh`: the CLI
- `slogin`: alias for ssh, accepting the same flags
- `scp`: secure copy, the encrypted version of `cp`

In 1995, Tatu YlÃ¶nen (a researcher from Helsinki University) launched the first version of SSH (SSH-1). Over time, many bugs were discovered and in 2006 a new set of Secure Shell protocols was adopted (SSH-2).

The old version used *public-key cryptography*[1] to authenticate to the remote machine, which SSH-2 replaced with *Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange*[2]. There are several encryption methods available in SSH-2, but the most used ones are *AES*[3] and *Blowfish*[4].

SSH is included by default in Linux, Unix-like and OSX operating systems, but not in Windows. Typically, an SSH server listens on the standard TCP port 22.

> ðŸ’¡ There is no evidence of any exploits for SSH-2 yet, however, some documents leaked by Edward Snowden state that some might be available.

## Footnotes

[1:Public-key encryption]
It uses a public and a private key to encrypt data. These keys are large numbers that have been paired together. The public key can be shared with everyone, whilst the private key is kept secret.

[2:Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange]
It's a method of digital encryption which uses numbers raised to specific powers to generate decryption keys.

[3: AES]
It stands for Advanced Encryption Standard. It was also chosen by the U.S. government to protect classified data.

[4: Blowfish]
It's an encryption algorithm that uses an variable-length key (form 32 to 448 bits).
