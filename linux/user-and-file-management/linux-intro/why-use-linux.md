# Why Use Linux?

---
## Content

There's many reasons you would choose Linux over other operating systems, so let's start with the biggest one: **it's completely free to use**.

To be more specific, all of Linux is *open-source*[1]. For this reason, there's about 600 *flavours* of Linux available, but we'll come back to this.

If you're not already convinced, here's a couple more reasons:
- fitted for any system (from low-end to high-end)
- secure (no antivirus needed)
- fully customizable
- and many others...

Don't take our word for it, take [Stack Overflow's](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-platforms). Their 2019 survey shows that Linux is the most popular platform used for development work. That has to count for something right?

## Footnotes

[1:Open-Source]
This means that all of the code that makes Linux is available to *everyone* and it can be freely redistributed and modified.
