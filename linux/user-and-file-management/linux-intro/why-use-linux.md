# Why Use Linux?

---
## Content

There are many reasons to choose Linux over other operating systems. Let's start with the fact that **it's completely free to use**.

To be more specific, all of Linux is *open-source*[1]. For this reason, there are about 600 *flavors* of Linux available. We'll cover some of them later.

And here are a few more reasons to use Linux:
- It *works with any system* (from low-end to high-end)
- It's *secure* (no antivirus needed)
- It's *fully customizable*

For these reasons, Linux is the most popular platform used by developers (according to Stack Overflow; see the Learn More link).
