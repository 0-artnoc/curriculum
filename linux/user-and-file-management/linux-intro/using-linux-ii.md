# Using Linux II

## Content

With the files downloaded, the first step is creating the bootable USB device.

Start off by installing Etcher. Depending on the original operating system, might look slightly different, but *the process is identical*.

After installing, opening the app should show:

Go ahead and click `Select image`, and browse for the Ubuntu file that you have downloaded.

If your USB device is already connected, you should see this screen[1]:

Last step is pressing `Flash!` and waiting for the confirmation screen, which should look like this:

It means that now is the time to connect your USB device.
