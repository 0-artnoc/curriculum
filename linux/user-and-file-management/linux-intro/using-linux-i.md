# Using Linux I

---
## Content

All this talk, and we still didn't show you how to use Linux ðŸ˜….

Luckily, there's a way for you to test Linux before making a final decision.

> Note: we'll be showing you how to install Ubuntu, but most distributions should show you how to install them in their documentation.

To start using Ubuntu, you'll need a 4GB USB device and a computer. Depending on the original operating system that the computer runs, the steps will slightly differ.

Start off by downloading the following files:
- [Ubuntu Desktop](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) file[1]
- [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to create the bootable[2] USB

In the next insight we'll create a USB device such that whenever you power your computer with the device connected, you'll be using Ubuntu instead of the original operating system.

## Footnotes

[1:Version]
We recommend you download the LTS version.

LTS stands for long term support, and it is the most stable version. If you're feeling experimental, go ahead and download the latest version.

[2:Bootable]
Making your USB device bootable means that whenever you start you computer, if the device is connected, the operating system will first run the files on the USB device.
