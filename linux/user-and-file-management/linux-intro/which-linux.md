# Which Linux?

## Content

Because of how popular and customizable Linux is, there's almost 600 different *flavours* available. In technical terms these are called **distributions**, or **distros** for short.

Although it is good to have such variety, you might find yourself encountering a bit of [choice paralysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overchoice). Don't worry, we're here to help you make a decision.

If you're just starting out, we recommend **Ubuntu** (that's what we're using 👐). It is perfect for beginners, and has the added benefit of being one of the top used and supported distros.

> Note: check the Learn More section if you want to discover more distros.
