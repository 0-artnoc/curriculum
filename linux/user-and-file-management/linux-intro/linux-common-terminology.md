# Common Terminology

---
## Content


Let's go over a few terms that you'll see a lot in this course.

A **command** is just a piece of text that you type into the **terminal**. Think of this as an instruction that you give to your computer.

Sometimes you might type some commands which are restricted. That's where the **root user** comes in. It's the unique admin user, with superpowers. Unsurprisingly, it's also called the **superuser**.

The **package manager** removes the tedious process of installing or uninstalling apps. Think of a **package** as being an app.

Remember the terminal? Well, this is also referred to as the **shell**. 

Linux comes with an improved version of the shell, which is called **bash**[1] (**Bourne-Again SHell**). From now on, we'll be using these terms interchangeably.

> **Note:** as with all the skills in the app, if you want to access more advanced or specific content at any time, **feel free to use the *Skill Map* tab** to jump to the workouts most relevant for you.
