# Built-In Options

---
## Content

Zapier wants to provide a built-in option for the most used integrations, for some actions that you would do often, or for actions that can't be found in any other apps (e.g. delay).

Out of the most popular options, you can distinguish:
- Email
    - you can send emails without having an account for any provider
- SMS
    - same as with email
- Delay
    - you can set timer for when your action should happen
- Formatter
    - transform the data you receive (e.g. take a string and convert it to lowercase)
- Schedule
    - same as delay, but the input is a specified interval (e.g. every week)


There are many other [built-in options](https://zapier.com/apps/categories/zapier-tools), and you can usually find them by searching for `'Zapier'`.
