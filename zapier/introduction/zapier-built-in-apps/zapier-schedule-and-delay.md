# Schedule & Delay

---
## Content

Starting off with the Schedule built-in app, this provides only triggers depending on how often you want your actions to happen. Your options consists of:
- every day
- every week
- every month
- every hour

On the other hand, the Delay built-in app provides only actions. These actions are used to control when an action happen, allowing you to queue your flow:
- delay for
    - when encountered in the flow, the zap will wait for the specified amount of time
- delay until
    - the zap will wait until a set date or time
- delay after queue
    - this option delays an action depending on the last queued delay
