# Maintaining Zaps

---
## Content

At some point in the future you might want to edit or remove a zap previously created.

First, to see all your zaps, you can head on to the [My Zaps](https://zapier.com/app/zaps) section, where you will be able to see all the zaps you have created.

In here you can:
* find your created zaps
* turn them on and off
* organize your zaps in folders
* share folders and zaps
* look in the `'Trash'` section

You can also go to your [dashboard](https://zapier.com/app/dashboard) where Zapier will offer you recommendations, a quick way of integrating two apps, and how far your have leveled in Zapier.
