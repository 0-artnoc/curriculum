# What Are Filters?

---
## Content

Filters represent a very important part of Zapier because they allow you to control which data goes forward in the flow. Basically, if the received information does not fit a certain constraint (defined by you), then the flow won't continue. 

Adding a filter is as easy as adding a new step, all you have to do is choose `'Filter by Zapier'` as your app.

We have briefly used a filter in the past to check wether a column in our spreadsheet had a certain value or not. One important feature of filters is that they are not limited to one constraint per step.

Going back to the zap we have created, for step 2 (the filter step), let's add another constraint. After clicking on the step card, go to the `'Filter Setup & Testing'` section. It should look something like this:

In the following insights we'll learn how to add more constraints, their types, and how powerful they are.
