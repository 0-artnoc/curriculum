# Searching Task History

---
## Content

No matter the number of zaps you work with, at some point you will find your task history filled with records. You can imagine how hard it can get to manually search through hundreds (or even thousands) of records just to find out what the problem is.

Fortunately, you will never have to do a manual search. Without clicking on any record, there are multiple ways of filtering. One of the first steps you should take, before even opening the `'Task History'` page, is giving your zaps a name (preferably a unique one). This can be done:
- either in the zap editor (just click on the name)

- from your dashboard (by clicking on the small arrow)

Notice that when looking at zaps from your dashboard, you have the option to show the task history only for that zap, which might help you out in the beginning.

In the following insight, we'll take a look at all the possible filtering you can do in the task history.
