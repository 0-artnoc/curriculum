# What is the task history?

---
## Content

Although the zaps that we have shown you didn't encounter any problems (in part because we didn't test them ðŸ¤­), but that is not always the case. The data you receive might not fit your filter, or you might not receive any data at all.

The task history in Zapier provides an answer to all of these problems (and a couple others as well). It provides a list of all the tasks that have ever been performed in your Zapier account. The list has it's own panel called [Task History](https://zapier.com/app/history) which looks something like this:

Another way of accessing the task history when editing a zap is by clicking the clock button on the right-hand side of the screen (above the cogwheel representing Setting)
