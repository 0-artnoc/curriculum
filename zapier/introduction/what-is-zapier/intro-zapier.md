## Content

You might have used Gmail, Trello, Twitter, Facebook, Paypal or any other popular app by now. It is likely that you are using more than one concomitantly too, but did you know there is a way to connect all the apps that you use?

Founded back in 2011, Zapier has grown to be one of the most used task automation tools. For example, you can make it such that you receive an email every time a change is made in a spreadsheet.

Your first thought might be 'Hey, this is awesome, but I don't know how to code üôÅ', but you don't need any previous knowledge to use Zapier. One of its best features is that it is a no-code tool.
