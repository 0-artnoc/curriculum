# Zapier Dependencies

---
## Content

With so many features and possibilities, you'd think that Zapier requires many dependencies or a complicated install process. The truth is, you only need an account to get started with Zapier.

To create your account head to the [Zapier's official registration website](https://zapier.com/sign-up/). You can do this through either Google, Facebook or plain email.

The free version of Zapier is very useful for getting used to the tool and creating some personal integrations, but has its limitations.

Zapier provides many other premium plans that are tailored to your application. To find out more, you can check out the [Official Plans & Pricing](https://zapier.com/pricing) section of their website.
