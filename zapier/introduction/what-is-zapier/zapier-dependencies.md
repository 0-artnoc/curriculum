# Zapier Dependencies

---
## Content

With so many features and possibilities you'd think that Zapier requires many dependencies or a complicated install process. The truth is, using Zapier is as easy as creating an account.

All you have to do is go to [Zapier's official registration website](https://zapier.com/sign-up/) followed by creating an account through either Google, Facebook or just email. That's it, you're now ready to use Zapier.

The free version of Zapier is very useful for getting used to the tool and creating some personal integrations, but has its limitations.

Zapier provides many other premium plans that are tailored to your application. To find out more, you can check out the [Official Plans & Pricing](https://zapier.com/pricing) section of their website.
