# Integration

---
## Content

As we have previously mentioned, you can use Zapier to connect many popular applications and create complicated logic.

Other than the popular applications that you already know, Zapier provides integration possibilities for more than 1500 applications. On the off-chance that your app is not included, you can still find a way to integrate it (possibly using another application as a bridge).

If you need any more convincing, here are a couple of examples:
  1. Get email notifications for new Google Forms responses
  2. Collect new TypeForm responses as rows on Google Sheets
  3. Post approaching Google Calendar events to a Slack channel

These are only simple examples that connect two applications, but Zapier is not limited to that.

Some features include:
- hooking multiple applications
- reading, writing & updating data
- setting filters for data
- manipulating data between integration steps
- debugging using task history & stops
- others
