# Zapier Dependencies

---
## Content

Now that you have your account, you are ready to start using Zapier.

In this insight we'll explore some of the common terminology used when talking about zapier integrations. Here is a list to help you get started[1]:
- **zap**
  - this refers to the automated workflow that connects apps and services
  - think of a zap as your entire integration
  - e.g. we have previously mentioned that you can get email notification for each Google form completion. This is a zap.
- **trigger**
  - this represents an event that starts a zap
  - in our example, the trigger would be the submittal of the Google form
- **action**
  - this represents an event that will be performed by our zap after a trigger
  - going back to the example, the action is getting the email notification
- **task**
  - this is more a general term that refers to any single action performed by Zapier
  - in our example, submitting a form **or** receiving an email notification are both actions
  - as you have already noticed, both triggers and tasks can be actions

Now, you are ready to create your first zap.

## Practice

Match the words with their description:

```text
zap     ???
trigger ???
action  ???
task    ???
```

* The entire integration.
* An event that starts a zap.
* An event that will be performed be the zap after a trigger.
* Any single action performed by Zapier.
