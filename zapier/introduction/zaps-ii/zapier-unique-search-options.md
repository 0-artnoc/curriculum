# Unique Search Actions

---
## Content

Up until now, we have only used Slack and Google Sheets in our zaps. Considering that there are more than 1500 possible applications in Zapier, we have used less that 1% of our possibilities (we've done the math on this).

Depending on the type of application you use or integrate, you will find that each have their own actions.

In this insight, we will present you the process of finding out all the possible actions and integrations, which can be used with any app.

To find out what unique search actions (or triggers) an app can have, you'll first have to head on over to [Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps) and select the app in question.

Let's say our stack contains Dropbox and Instagram.

When selecting an app from the list, Zapier shows you:
* a list of recommended integrations
* recommended templates
* some extra information
* all the possible triggers, actions and searches
