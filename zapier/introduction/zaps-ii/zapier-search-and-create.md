# Search and Create

---
## Content

Depending on the app that you are using, Zapier allows you to create date after doing a search action.

A good workflow example would be to monitor some data, and when a certain condition is met you create a new record/data.

Let's take another look at the zap we have created. After you receive a message that a person was given access to your base, you want to write a new cell that specifies the number of access days.

Go ahead and add another Google Sheets step to our zap, right at the end of the flow. This time, we want to create a new column, so you would have to search the `'Choose Action Event'` drop-down for the `'Create Spreadsheet Column'` option.
