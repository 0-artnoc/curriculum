# Zapier Data

---
## Content

Until now, we have only used simple actions in our zaps (monitoring some data or sending a message). Zapier is not limited to that, with another popular application being finding data and using it at a later time.

We have somewhat done this, when we used the filter step to verify that someone has actually gained access to our base.

Now, what if we want to know who has gained access to our base? This is entirely possible, and since we are using Google Sheets we don't require any extra steps.

All that you would have to do is go to the Slack step, and in the `'Message Text'` box you can already access all the information seen in the linked spreadsheet.
