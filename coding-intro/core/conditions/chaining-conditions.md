# Chaining Conditions

---
## Content

Now, knowing that `0` means "do nothing", we'll want the robot to take an action if any button between `1 - 9` is pressed:

```plain-text
IF (input == 0) THEN
  Do nothing.
ELSE
  Make a grilled cheese.
```

You have now chained two conditions. If the `input` is anything other than 0, then the robot will start making a grilled cheese sandwich.

The next step is to create different *paths*:
- `0` for doing nothing
- `1` for white bread
- `2` for whole wheat bread
- `3` for rye bread

```plain-text
IF (input == 0) THEN
  Do nothing.
ELSE IF (input == 1) THEN
  Use white bread.
ELSE IF (input == 2) THEN
  Use whole-wheat bread.
ELSE IF (input == 3) THEN
  Use rye bread.
```

You can chain multiple conditions using `ELSE IF`. If the `input` is `3` then the robot will use white bread, **and it won't even check the other conditions** because that one evaluated to `true`.

> ðŸ’¡ The final `ELSE` clause is optional.

## Practice

Complete the condition such that you only make a sandwich if you're hungry:

```plain-text
hungry = ???

??? (???) THEN
  Make a sandwich
???
```

* true
* IF
* hungry
* ENDIF

## Revision

Complete the following condition chain:

```plain-text
??? condition_1 THEN
  do something
??? condition_2 THEN
  do something
???
  do something
```

* IF
* ELSE IF
* ELSE
