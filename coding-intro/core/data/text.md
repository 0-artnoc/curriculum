# Text

## Content

The text type is almost never called *text*. Instead, it is referred to as a **string** because it is a **string/list of characters**[1]. From now on we'll refer to it as a **string**.

We've already encountered this type before when creating the `best_app` variable. Now, let's make another one:

```plain-text
best_user = "You"
```

> ðŸ’¡ Strings **commonly have to be enclosed by quotation marks** (`" "`). In some programming languages, you can also use single quotation marks (`' '`) or backticks (`` ` ` ``).

## Practice

Strings commonly have to be enclosed by ???.

* quotation marks
* parentheses
* square brackets
* commas

## Revision

Complete the gaps to define a string:

```plain-text
my_name ??? ???
```

* =
* "Andrei"
* Andrei
* ==

[1:String]

The term "string" was used to describe a sequence of characters before the existence of computers. 

When printing became available to the general public, companies used to bill customers based on the length of the print. This length was usually measured by the length of the characters tied with a piece of string.

About a century later, the term made its way into computer science where it held the same meaning, a string of characters.
