## Content

> Don't worry about the quotation marks around `Enki` for now. We'll explain them in the insights coming up.

When programming, this would usually be done with the `=` sign:

```
best_app = "Enki"
```

## Practice

```plain-text
??? ??? ???
```

* best_user

* "You"
* best user
* ==

## Revision

Match the operator with its definition:

```plain-text
Assignment - ???
Equality   - ???
```

* =
* ==
