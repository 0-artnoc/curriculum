# Data Types

---
## Content

In real life, you can split entities into different types. All items of that type have some common characteristics. 

For example, you could think of *species* as being different types. Although not all animals belonging to a species are the same, they still have many characteristics in common.

Just as in real life, everything in programming has a data type. The most common ones are:
- number
- text
- list

There are many more types, but you'll start learning them as you dive into a specific programming language. 

Data types are very important! They decide what actions you can and cannot take for a particular data type. One example is that you can't add the number `1` to the text `"one"`.
