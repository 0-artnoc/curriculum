# Function Assembly

---
## Content

Your robot is almost ready! The last step is calling all the functions.

> ðŸ’¡ The order in which we call the functions matters! You wouldn't want it to prepare the cheese after it fried the sandwich.

```plain-text
FUNCTION make_a_sandwich
  INPUT: prepare_ingredients, assemble_sandwich, fry_sandwich.
  Instruct robot to execute prepare_ingredients.
  Instruct robot to execute assemble_sandwich.
  Instruct robot to execute fry_sandwich.
  OUTPUT: grilled cheese sandwich.
ENDFUNCTION
```

> ðŸ’¡ You should give your functions explanatory names. A good rule is to use verb-noun combinations (`prepare_ingredients`). If your functions require two verbs or nouns for its identifier, it's probably doing too much and you should split it into separate functions
