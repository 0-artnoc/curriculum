# Hello Code?

---
## Content

In this course, we'll teach you the **very basics** of programming.

We'll cover variables, functions (or methods), conditional statements, and loops.

> ðŸ’¡ These concepts are found in most programming languages. They are the required minimum to understand or write software.

We won't cover any language-specific features or advanced concepts.

For the entirety of this course, we'll use [pseudocode](https://enki.com/glossary/general/pseudocode). This is how you write the bare functionality, without details of a specific language. 

When you finish this course and move on to specific programming languages, you'll be taught that language's [syntax](https://enki.com/glossary/general/syntax).

> ðŸ’¡ At the end of this course, you'll have several options for your next step. Here are some suggestions:
> - Python is the default programming language to start with. It's easy to learn, closest to the English language, and powerful.
> - SQL is a *querying* language and a good option as a stepping stone to learning a programming language. 
> - If you want to start by making a website, make sure you go through our Web course (which includes HTML and CSS).
