# Intro to Coding

---
## Content

If you want to learn to code, this course is the best place to start, before digging into your language(s) of choice. 

It's not meant to be an in-depth guide, but rather an overview of the core features everyone should know before starting to program.

Coding is nothing more than creating a set of instructions that your computer will follow. This set of instructions is considered a **program**.

You already interact with programs daily. From your phone, personal computer, your car, and your fridge - computer programs are everywhere.

We've come a long way since the 50s (when the first functioning programming languages were created), and these advances make it possible for anyone to learn. Programming is no longer only for scientists.
