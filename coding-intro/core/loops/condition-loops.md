# Condition Loops

---
## Content

Condition controlled loops are slightly different than counter loops. Instead of running until the counter reaches a certain value, you set a condition and the loop will run **while the condition evaluates to `true`**.

There are two types of condition controlled loops:
- the condition is checked at the beginning `WHILE..DO`
- the condition is checked at the end `DO..WHILE`

Depending on the type of application, you can use different loops. For example, your can require your users to type in a password when they log in. 

In this case, a `DO..WHILE` loop can be used. It will ask the user to input the password, check that it has the correct format and number of characters, and finally verify that it is correct. If it is, you exit the loop.

> ðŸ’¡ In programming, you can achieve the same functionality through different means. The same check can also be achieved using a `WHILE..DO` loop. It's up to you to choose the method and make it work.

## Practice

Complete the definitions:

```plain-text
DO..WHILE - ???
WHILE..DO - ???
```

* Runs the code once then checks the condition.
* Checks the condition then runs the code.
