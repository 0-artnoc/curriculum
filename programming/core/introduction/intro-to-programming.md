# Intro to Programming

---
## Content

This series will serve as an introduction to the Programming topic. It's not meant to be an in-depth guide, but rather an overview of the core features everyone should know before picking up programming.

Programming is nothing more than creating a set of instructions that your computer will follow. This set of instructions is considered a **program**.

You already interact with programs on a daily basis. From your phone and personal computer to your car and your fridge. Computer programs are everywhere.
