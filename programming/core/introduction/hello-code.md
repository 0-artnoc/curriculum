# Hello Code?

---
## Content

In this topic, we'll teach you the **very basics** of programming.

We'll cover variables, functions (or methods), conditional statements and loops.

We won't cover any language-specific features or advanced concepts.

For the entirety of this course, we'll use [pseudocode](https://enki.com/glossary/programming/pseudocode). This is how you write the bare functionality without details of a specific language. 

When you finish this topic, and move on to specific programming languages, you'll be taught that language's [syntax](https://enki.com/glossary/general/syntax).

> ðŸ’¡ At the end this course, you have to decide on your next step. To make things easier, we have some suggestions:
> - Python is a good starting point for your programming career. It's easy to learn, similar to the English language, and powerful.
> - If you're ever going to need a database, SQL is a good choice.
> - If you want to make your own website, take a look at our Web topic.
