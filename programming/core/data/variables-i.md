# Variables I

---
## Content

Variables represent the building blocks of programming. Without them, you couldn't really write any code more complex than a mathematical equation.

Think of a *variable* as a box. In it, you can put anything: books, linen, microwaves and so on. In the programming world, all those physical objects would be replaced by data (or information).

The more information you have, the more *boxes* you're going to need. But what do you do when you have five *boxes*, and you want to find specific data in one of them? You could, of course, open every one until you find what you're looking for.

A better alternative would be to put labels on your boxes. Then, you could easily find the data that you're looking for.

All in all, you can think of variables as these abstract, labelled boxes.
