# Lists

---
## Content

Lists, although a data type on their own, represent a collection of data types. Usually you can mix elements with different data types in a list, but some languages only let you use one data type in a list.

Lists are usually defined using square brackets `[ ]`, with the values (** or variables**) separated by commas inside.


Let's take a look at some examples:

```plain-text
users_list = ["Andrei", "Catalin", "Mihai"]
```

Or, you can use variables:

```plain-text
user1 = "Andrei"
user2 = "Catalin"
user3 = "Mihai"

users_list = [user1, user2, user3]
```
