# Delete a collection

---
## Content

To delete a collection in MongoDB, you need to use the `db.mycollection.drop()` method.

It's usually a good practice to first list all of the collections to make sure you don't delete the wrong one.

```javascript
show collections

// pokemon
// Pokemon
```

Here's how we can delete the 2nd collection called `Pokemon`.

```javascript
db.Pokemon.drop()
// true
```

**Note:** The only possible output for the `.drop()` method is `true` or `false`, indicating if the deletion was successful or not.

## Practice

Delete the collection named `Pokemon` from the current database:

```javascript
???.???.???
```

* `db`
* `Pokemon`
* `drop()`
* `pokemon`
* `deleteCollection()`
* `database`

## Revision

Delete the collection named `players` from the current database.

```javascript
db.???.???
```

* `players`
* `drop()`
* `Players`
* `delete()`
