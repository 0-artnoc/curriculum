# Deleting documents 2
---
## Content

Next to using the `db.collection_name.deleteOne()` or `.deleteMany()` methods to delete a single or multiple documents, we can use the `db.collection_name.findOneAndDelete()` or `db.collection_name.remove()` methods.

The `.findOneAndDelete()` method can be used to search through a collection and delete only the first document found based on the specified query. 

For instance, the query below searches for the first pok√©mon(document) whose `power` is greater than `1000` and deletes it:
```javascript
db.pokemon.findOneAndDelete({
  power: { $gt: 1000 }
})
```
Output:
```javascript
{
	"_id": 807,
	"name": "Zeraora",
	"type": "Electric",
	"power": 3012
}
```

**Note:** When executed, the query returns the document that was deleted.

### `.remove()`

The `.remove()` method can be used to delete a single, multiple or all documents at once based on the specified criteria.
Syntax:
```javascript
db.collection.remove(
  <query>,
  <justOne>
)
```

To delete all documents from a collection:
```javascript
db.pokemon.remove({})
```

To delete a single or multiple documents based on criteria:
```javascript
db.pokemon.remove({ 
	power: { $eq: 40 } 
})
```
Output:
```javascript
WriteResult({ "nRemoved": 11 })
```

In the above example, we have deleted all documents whose `power` field equals exactly `40`.

**Note:** The output of the `.remove()` method, whether it is deleting a single, multiple or all documents, will always be `WriteResult({"nRemoved": NUMBER})`. The `NUMBER` is the number of documents deleted.

To delete exactly one document based on specified criteria we need to add `true` or `1` for the `justOne` boolean parameter.

When using `.remove()` to delete a singular document, it works the same way as the `.findOneAndDelete()` method by deleting the first matching document.

**Note:** The `justOne` parameter is false by default.

Example:
```javascript
db.pokemon.remove( 
	{ "type": "Fire" },
	true 
)
```
Output:
```javascript
WriteResult({ "nRemoved": 1 })
```

## Practice

Delete all documents in the `pokemon` collection whose `type` equals `Water`.
```javascript
db.pokemon.???( 
	{ "???": "Water" } 
)
```

Remove all documents within the `pokemon` collection.
```javascript
???.???.???(???)
```

* `remove`
* `type`
* `db`
* `pokemon`
* `remove`
* `{}`
* `all`
* `[]`
* `deleteAll`
* `delete`
