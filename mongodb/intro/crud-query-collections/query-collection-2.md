# Querying a collection using ranges

---
## Content

Last insight we learned how to query documents and use the `$in` and `$or` operators.

Now, we will learn how to use the `$lt`, `$lte`, `$gt` or `$gte` comparison operators to find documents more precisely.

- `$lt` means less than the specified value
- `$lte` means less than or equal to the specified value
- `$gt` means greater than the specified value
- `$gte` means greater than or equal to the specified value

Let's say we have a `pokemon` collection where each pokémon has a `power` field which specifies their strength.

Now, we want to look through the `pokemon` collection and find all the pokémon that have their `power` level greater than `250`. We can do so like this:

```javascript
db.pokemon.find({ power: { $gt: 250 } });
```

Output:

```javascript
{
  "_id": 2,
  "name": "Bulbasaur",
  "type": "Grass",
  "secondType": "Poison",
  "power": 311
}
{
  "_id": 7,
  "name": "Ivisaur:",
  "type": "Grass",
  "secondType": "Poison",
  "power": 335
}
{
  "_id": 73,
  "name": "Tentacruel",
  "type": "Water",
  "secondType": "Poison",
  "power": 333
}
{
  "_id": 146,
  "name": "Moltres",
  "type": "Fire",
  "secondType": "Flying",
  "power": 404
}
// ...
```

The other 3 operators, `$lt`, `$lte` and `$gte`, are used in the exact same way as the `$gt` operator.

```javascript
db.pokemon.find({ power: { $gte: 250 } });

db.pokemon.find({ power: { $lt: 250 } });

db.pokemon.find({ power: { $lte: 250 } });
```

You can also use a combination of the above operators to create more precise queries. For instance, to find all pokemon that are `1` or less years old and have power greater than `350`:

```javascript
db.pokemon.find({
  power: { $gt: 350 },
  age: { $lte: 1 }
});
```

Output:
```javascript
// ...
{
  "_id": 146,
  "name": "Moltres",
  "type": "Fire",
  "secondType": "Flying",
  "power": 404
}
{
  "_id": 151,
  "name": "Mew",
  "type": "Psychic",
  "age": 1,
  "power": 404
}
// ...
```

**Note**: If we wanted the query above to find only the documents where one of the values is true, we would have to add the `$or` logical operator.

## Practice

Match the operator with the description:

`$lt` : ???
`$lte`: ???
`$gt` : ???
`$gte`: ???

* Less than
* Less than or equal to
* Greater than
* Greater than or equal to

---
## Revision

Create a query to find all documents within the `pokemon` collection whose `age` falls in the range 23-31, including the bounds.

```javascript
db.pokemon.???({ 
  ???: { ???: 23, ???: 31 }
});
```

* `find`
* `age`
* `$gte`
* `$lte`
* `$lt`
* `$gt`
* `%and`
