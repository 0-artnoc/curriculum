## Content


Each Bitcoin address has two keys: a public and a private one. You only share the public one and keep the private one secret.

A (digital) **wallet** is a piece of software that can listen to and interact with the network. In case it is also connected to the network, it can handle transactions and display the sum of UTXOs that had as recipient *an address generated by the wallet*.

Probably one of the bigest misconception people have about wallets is that your wallet is your address on the blockchain. But a cryptowallet may contain more than one address. Specifically for the Bitcoin network, it is also recommended to never reuse an old address (we'll cover the reasons why soon).
