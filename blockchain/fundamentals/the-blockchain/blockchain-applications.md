## Content

In the last insight, we briefly named Bitcoin and Ethereum. They are the reason why the blockchain technology became so widely known. Bitcoin is the first peer-to-peer digital currency, and while it reached record exchange levels of $19,000 per coin in the last month of 2017, its usability is limited to tracking bitcoin transactions.

Ethereum, on the other hand, is a blockchain that "has no features"[1]. This doesn't mean Ethereum has no purpose, but that it's rather trying provide the environment for the development of any project, built using its Turing-complete programming language called Solidity. 

Financial applications, personal records storage, or raw materials tracking are only some of the applications that benefit from being stored in so-called "smart contracts". Virtually anything that can be *uniquely identifiable* can also be stored on the blockchain.

The blockchain is not a merely disruptive technology[2], but a foundational[3] one. Step by step, in the course of next workouts, we will discuss in detail what comprises a blockchain and how it is built.

## Footnotes

[1: A blockchain with no features]
In the "Learn more" section you will find a link to an interview Vitalik Buterin had at TechCrunch Disrupt 2017.

[2: Disruptive technology]
A groundbreaking technology, that has a great impact on the current way of thinking and has the outcome of delivering the same or a better product at a lower cost than the current option. The terms usually refers to the higher levels of a process, the ones that are easier to change.

[3: Foundational technology]
A foundational technology, on the other hand, implies an altogether different way of thinking. The centralized foundation on which most systems (banking, shopping, social media) are built is bound to be rebuilt, granting users control over their own data. These changes will usually come at a greater cost and will take longer to be implemented.
