# How Do Cryptocurrencies Acquire Value?

---
## Content

In general, how do things acquire value? The answer is straightforward: they either serve a purpose/solve a problem (PC, cars, etc.) or enough people consider them to be valuable (currencies). The dollar/british pound/yen are useful because they can be used to buy food, a house or a car.

The currency is called dollar and is made of paper, but it might as well be a piece of coal, a rock, a clam, gold coin or a bitcoin. Anyhow, they become valuable because they are the common ground for trading. Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or litecoin (or any other blockchain that functions only as a ledger for transactions for that matter) are **owned by people** and can be **transferred freely** anywhere.

Using cryptographic functions, anyone that owns cryptocurrencies (cryptographic currencies) can prove that its theirs and only theirs by having a long, random string called private key. In this scenario, banks and third-party verification entities become obsolete. Or at least this was cypherpunks' vision.

For some, this vision was not grand enough. What would happen if you could extend the ledger to include everything you own? In theory, any database could be replicated on the blockchain, in practice less so: while cheap, disk space on personal machines is still limited until partitioning (sharding) is possible.

But emerging cryptocurrencies stopped going for the new dollar approach. Instead, they become exchange tokens on platforms that have a clear goal of solving a problem. If real money is saved, the token is inherently valuable. Moreover, allowing initial coin offerings (ICOs) allow common people to invest in ideas they belive in. While it is arguable that a similar plan can be concieved and released not on a blockchain, the transparency, integrity and the fault-tolerance of the blockchain make the balance weight towards it.
