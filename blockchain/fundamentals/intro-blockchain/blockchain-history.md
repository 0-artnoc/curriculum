# Blockchain History

## Content
           	
Theoretical blockchains go back to the early 90's, when multiple different projects were aiming to create fully digitized, decentralized and securitized payment systems[1]. Most of them never had the chance to see the light of day, and those which did were unsuccessful.

However, in January 2009, the first public blockchain was released - the Bitcoin blockchain. It was created by a person or group of people named Satoshi Nakamoto. More to come on this later.

What is important to point out is that, although, limited in functionality, Bitcoin worked as a proof-of-concept for more complex blockchains. The peer-to-peer payment system pioneered by Bitcoin allowed forward thinkers to extend the concept to incorporate applications like crowdfunding, domain registration, prediction markets, voting, and so on.

## Footnotes

[1: Projects old as time]
Nick Szabo's `bit gold` is the one most similar to Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin, but just in theory. It had never come to see the light of day.

`DigiCash` was also a company trying to create a fully digital currency. Founded by David Chaum in 1990, it filed for bankruptcy in late 90's.
