# What Is a Blockchain?

---
## Content

A **blockchain** (a literal chain of blocks) is a peer-to-peer network designed to build and maintain a sequence of information bundles.

The best way to explain it is through an analogy. Let's say you made a purchase on Ebay.

A block will store that transaction's information (e.g. the price, product, date). 

It will also store data about who is participating in said transaction (in this case you and Ebay).

Lastly, the block is given a unique identifier.

When all of the above are complete, this new block is added to, you guessed it, the blockchain.
