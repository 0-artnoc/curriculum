# MetaMask

---
## Content

Like for bitcoins, you need a wallet to be able to hold any ether. The Ethereum client works well if you are looking to also run a node. In this workout we'll discuss some alternatives.

**MetaMask** is a browser extension that allows you to interact with the Ethereum network without having to download the entire chain. Moreover, it supports any ERC20 token (standards for the win!) alongside ETH.

It is a simple interface that stores any generated keys offline, on your computer. With MetaMask, you can use Ethereum dapps in any browser that supports the extension.
