# MyEtherWallet

---
## Content

Like for bitcoins, you need a wallet to be able to hold any ether. The Ethereum client works well if you are looking to also run a node. For quick transfers and everything else, there's **MyEtherWallet**[1].

MyEtherWallet is a free, open-source, client-side interface. It allows for direct interactions with the blockchain without transferring your keys and funds anywhere. A new account on MyEtherWallet means generating a private key/public key pair, whose handling happen inside the browser. 

But keep something in mind (as it is mentioned all over on the website): you are responsible for keeping track of whatever keys your generating as MyEtherWallet is just an *interface* and cannot be used to recover wallets. You being is charge of your security and funds is part of blockchains' raison d'Ãªtre.

Note that if you are already using Metamask, you can easily connect it to MyEtherWallet.
