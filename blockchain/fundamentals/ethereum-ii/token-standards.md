# Token Standards

---
## Content

An Ethereum **token** is a smart contract that has a mapping between user addresses and balances. In other words, it is a contract that keeps track of how much of something each address has. A **token standard** is a smart contract that implements some standard functions that all other contracts share, namely `transfer` or `balanceOf`.

Token standards are therefore Ethereum's way of seizing and simplyfing the creation of new cryptocurrencies. There are 2 main standards:
- ERC20
- ERC721

By following either one of them, programmers can ditch releasing a blockchain platform of their own and start using an already secured and successful platform. Moreover, the interface is common between all tokens such that interactions with external platforms are also eased. Exchanges, for example, are platforms that benefit a lot from the shared interface.
