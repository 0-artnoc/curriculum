# Intro to Solidity


---
## Content

**Solidity** a programming language that can compiled into bytecode and run by the EVM. But the relationship between Solidity and EVM is not one-to-one. Solidity is a contract-oriented language that can work on multiple platforms. Moreover, it is part of the set of languages in which Ethereum smart contracts can be developed.

As specified by Wood it is designed around the ECMAScript syntax to make it familiar for existing web developers;[citation needed] unlike ECMAScript it has static typing and variadic return types. Compared to other EVM-targeting languages of the time such as Serpent and Mutan, Solidity contained a number of important differences. Complex member variables for contracts including arbitrarily hierarchical mappings and structs were supported. Contracts support inheritance, including multiple inheritance with C3 linearization. An application binary interface (ABI) facilitating multiple type-safe functions within a single contract was also introduced (and later supported by Serpent). A documentation system for specifying a user-centric description of the ramifications of a method-call was also included in the proposal, known as "Natural Language Specification".[19][20]

## Practice

What does solidity run on?

???

* EVM
* Blockchain
* Any computer
* Ethereum blockchain

## Revision

Why does one pay gas to publish a smart contract on the blockchain?

???

* To prove their honesty 
* To support the Ethereum foundation
* To tip the nodes that run the code
* To speed up the verification process
