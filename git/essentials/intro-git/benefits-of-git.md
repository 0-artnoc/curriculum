# Benefits of Git

---
## Content

Let's talk a bit about what **Git** brings to the table.

1. Apart from syncing changes, everything can be done locally.
2. Each *clone* has a full history of changes.
3. Something happened with the main version? **Recreate it** using a local version.
4. It seems your new code introduces an unforseen bug. **Revert** the change until you find a fix.
5. **Flexible**. You don't have to a developer to use it. Some other professions include *marketing*, *designing*, *human resources*.
