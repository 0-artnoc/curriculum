## Content

Another important display settings is the flex layout.

The general approach to this is that you create a container and set its display setting to flex. In doing so, all the container's children will have the flex display setting.

Elements that use the flex layout will arrange their direct children horizontally or vertically.

This option also allows you to decide when the children will be in the same row, stacked, or any other display options. Hence the flex name.
