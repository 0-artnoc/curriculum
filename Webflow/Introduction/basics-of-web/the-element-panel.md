There are 3 ways to add an element to your project. 

1. You can select the place you want to add your element by clicking on it, then open the `Add Element Panel` and click on the element you want.
2. You can open the `Add Element Panel` and drag and drop the desired element to the desired location on the canvas.
3. You can open the `Add Element Panel` and drag and drop the desired element on the desired location in the navigator.

The 3rd option is the most precise because you don't have to aim the element's box to make sure you add it to the correct place. You can just drop in the appropriate location within the navigator.
