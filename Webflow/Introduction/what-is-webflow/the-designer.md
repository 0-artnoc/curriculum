# The Designer

---
## Content

One of the most powerful features Webflow has to offer is called the `Designer`.

With this feature, you can create and design responsive websites using customizable pre-made templates or by starting from scratch.

With the `Designer` you can create a fully functional website without looking at or writing a single line of code.

This interactive website building software is completely customizable and it is where you will spend most of your time.

The `Designer` consists of 5 main elements:
- The left toolbar and panels ( Used for structuring your website, adding navigation, new elements and much more)
- The Canvas(Provides real-time webpage interaction where you can see the end result as well as modify any element by dragging and dropping, resizing and more)
- The top bar(Page number, save, undo, publish, export code and few more features)
- The bottom navigation breadcrumb bar(Mostly for navigation with a visible and clickable hierarchy of elements)
- The right panels(Gives powerful control for each of your elements)

To access the `Designer`:

If you have no projects:
- Go to the `dashboard -> new project`.
