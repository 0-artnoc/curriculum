# What I need to use Webflow?

---
## Content

To use `Webflow`, all you need is an account.

 `Webflow` has a free to use version called "Starter Plan", where you can use a variety of their tools without paying for anything. However, a lot of more powerful tools are only available in the premium version.

The free to use version is essentially there so customers can review and test the program for as long as they want without spending any money. You can even make a responsive website for free and host a prototype version on their domain. However, you cannot make it live or download the code without paying.

To make an account, go to [webflow.com](www.webflow.com):

After selecting either of the 2 buttons a new popup screen will appear to choose one of the 2 options:

The top button will open a new popup window asking you to confirm the password for the currently logged in google account. Whereas the 2nd will let you type your desired e-mail.

Next, you will be greeted with a couple of questions so they can tailor the experience to your needs and expertise.

After completing the on-screen steps, depending on what you chose, you will get a screen similar to this one:

The free version, or the "Starter Plan" Offers these features:

This means you can have 2 unhosted projects at the same time for free. Also, you can publish your projects on `"webflow.io"` subdomain for free to share as prototypes. The 2 free projects also have a maximum of 2 pages per project.

There are 2 premium versions, `Lite` and `Pro`.

Both premium versions allow live hosting of your created websites, 100 pages per project and code export. The `Lite` version offers a maximum of 10 projects, while the `Pro` version offers unlimited.

The `Pro` version also offers "White labeling" and "Site Password"
