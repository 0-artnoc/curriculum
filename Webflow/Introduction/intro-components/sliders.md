# Sliders

## Content

A Slider is a simple but very powerful component.

Sliders can be used to create any number of things, like a slideshow of some pictures or a product. 

On `Webflow`, when you create a Slider, it comes pre-designed with some elements.

Default Slider:

![default-slider](https://img.enkipro.com/44960d891625b50c689a04bf7bd88d72.png)

The default slider has 2 navigation buttons (highlighted in purple), a `Slider nav` element with a link per page of the slider and a `Mask` element that contains all the slides.

Default slider viewed in the `Navigator`:

To add a `Slider` to your webpage:

- Click anywhere on the Canvas and left-click a `Slider` element from the `Add Elements` panel to add it to the previously clicked position.

- Drag and drop a `Slider` element from the `Add Elements` panel anywhere on the canvas.

- Drag and drop a `Slider` element from the `Add Elements` panel to a position in the `Navigator`.


To add a new slide element to your `Slider`, select the `Slider` and add a new slide in the `Slider Settings` panel on the right side of the screen.

You can also add a new slide by copying and pasting an existing one.

The `Slider settings` panel can also be used to add animation, an attribute or to select a specific slide.

A good example of a `Slider` is how Netflix presents its categories.

As you can see, Netflix has sliders for each category separated into several movies per slide. The number of movies per slide depends on the screen size.
