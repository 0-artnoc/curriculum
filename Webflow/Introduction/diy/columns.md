# Columns

---
## Content

Columns are layout elements used for organizing content side by side horizontally.

Each one of the columns is self-contained. Meaning they can have different styles, be of different sizes and/or have different elements inside them.

By default when you create a new column element it is divided into 2 columns. 

Also, the total sizes of all columns in a row add up to 12. Twelve being 100% of the width of the element. So if you have 2 columns, setting them both on size 6 would make them 50% each. 

Default column element:

To edit the number of columns and their sizes, click on the column element and select the "gear" symbol.

**Note:** Each "Column" element consists of a single row of columns.

You can edit the sizes of the columns by moving the numbers on the bottom of the `Columns Settings` panel. There are different default values depending on the number of columns you select and all are customizable.

To create a column element is the same as creating a section or container element. There are 3 ways:

1. Click anywhere on the canvas and left-click a column element from the `Add Elements` panel to add it to the previously clicked position.

2. Drag and drop a column element from the `Add Elements` panel anywhere on the canvas.

3. Drag and drop a column element from the `Add Elements` panel to a position in the `Navigator`.

Example of a Column element with 4 columns where 3 are images and 1 is a list:
