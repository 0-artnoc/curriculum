# Java Versions

---
## Content

Here's a little history for you. Java was first released in 1995, and since then there have been many major versions. 

With continuous improvements, the Java team has introduced a lot of new features and bug fixes, pushing it to the top of the most used programming languages.

From a couple of hundred classes in *Java 1.0*, Java had grown to three thousand classes in *Java 5*. By *Java 8*, the number grew to be around 4300 classes.

Transitioning from one version to another has always left room for problems. Usually backporting (making new features available to older versions) was the most troublesome. Deprecated classes or optimizations made to the existing ones were also reasons for code to break. One way to prevent this from happening was to stop public support for older versions.

Because of the reasons mentioned above, the *latest* Java version is always subject to change. To check support availability you can either go on the [Java version history wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history) or check the [official support roadmap](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/java-se-support-roadmap.html).
