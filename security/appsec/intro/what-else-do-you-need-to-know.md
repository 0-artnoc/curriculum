## Content

AppSec is a diverse field that means more than just keeping current on vulnerability research[1].

Before diving into this topic, you should make sure you have a strong foundation in:
- Operating Systems
- How memory in a computer works, and where data is located at any given time
- At least one scripting language (even bash, check out our other topics)
- Network Protocols (check our **Linux - Networking** course)

In this topic we'll teach you:
- The **Open Systems Interconnection Model** (OSI Model)
- How to apply appropriate controls to minimize vulnerability
- How to identify and mitigate different attacks
- How to evaluate source code for vulnerabilities
- How to identify and protect sensitive data
- And many others!

> ðŸ’¡ As with all the skills in the app, if you want to access more advanced or specific content at any time, **feel free to use the *Skill Map* tab** to jump to the workouts most relevant for you.

## Footnotes

[1:Levels of AppSec]
It's something everyone needs to know at some level, so that when major outbreaks occur they can take steps to protect themselves and the applications they develop

At more advanced levels, it means strictly following regulatory guidelines to ensure certain kinds of data are very well protected. At very advanced levels, it can mean research, penetration testing, and more.
