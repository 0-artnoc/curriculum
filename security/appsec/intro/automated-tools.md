# Automated Tools

---
## Content

The beautiful thing about creating an automated exploit is that you never have to do it by hand again, and neither does anyone else. 

This makes automated exploit development very dangerous if it gets into the wrong hands.

Because of this, white-hat (ie. good guy) exploit researchers will publish vulnerability scanning tools that allow penetration testers to demonstrate the vulnerability, in order to mitigate it. 

This is also very handy tooling for application developers, as you can scan your application for vulnerability as you develop it, as a regular cycle.

## Practice

In order to develop applications that cannot be scanned for vulnerabilities, you should periodically ??? your ??? using ???.

* scan
* application
* an automated tool
* attack
* sniff
* crack
* coworker's email
* a password cracker
* a packet sniffer

## Revision

In order to find vulnerable ports and network devices, you would use a ???

* packet sniffer
* wi-fi hijacker
* password cracker
* port forwarder
