# OWASP Top Ten

---
## Content

OWASP's Top Ten list is a great place to start for learning the practice of identifying, and mitigating vulnerabilities. It's not a comprehensive list, but it will protect you from being the easiest target. From there, you'll build your security practice by learning to use tools to identify other vulnerabilities.

Start by reading the top ten list. Pick one vulnerability, and find an automated tool that will allow you to scan for it in your application, or follow the recommended mitigation strategy. During this course we'll provide you with one vulnerability and mitigation strategy per day, so keep up with your workouts and you'll be secure in no time!
