# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and it was adapted for the `curriculum` repository.

**Format**

The general format is:

```md
## Date
### Type of change
- [Topic Name - Insight Name - Description of the change](link-to-the-PR-or-commit-where-the-change-was-added)
```

`Date` represents the date on which the PR was merged.

If more than one insight is changed in the PR, you can:

- use the workout name with an appropriate description

```md
- [Topic Name - Workout Name - Description that applies to all insights changed](link-to-the-PR-or-commit-where-the-change-was-added)
```

- write an entry for each insight using the same PR link:

```md
- [Topic Name - Insight Name 2 - Description](link-to-the-PR)
- [Topic Name - Insight Name 1 - Description](link-to-the-PR)
```

Types of change:

- `Added` for new content (e.g. a new insight, workout, topic).
- `Changed` for changes in the existing content (e.g. changing the concepts or structure of an existing insight).
- `Archived` for content that is no longer necessary and has been archived.
- `Fixed` for any minor fixes (e.g. add a missing comma, adding a code block tag, fixing a report).
