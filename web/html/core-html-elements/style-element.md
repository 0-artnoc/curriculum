# Style element

---
## Content

The HTML `style` element is used to style the content of an html document. Also, there is a `style` attribute used to achieve the same thing, but per element.

Example 1:
```html
<p style="color: red"> 
  Color of this text is red.
</p>
```
Output:

The above example, colors only that single paragraph element. 

If we would like to color all paragraphs within the whole HTML document, we would add the `style` element at the top of the document.
However, if we add a style attribute to any `<p>` element, it would override our top level style element.

Example 2:
```html
<style>
  p {
    color: red;
  }
</style> 
  
<p> 
  Color of this text is red.
</p>
```
Same output:

Example 3:
```html
<style>
  p {
    color: red;
  }
</style> 
  
<p style="color: teal"> 
  Color of this text is no longer red.
</p>
```
Output:

The `style` element also has 4 attributes which are all optional and will be discussed in the Style course:
  - type
  - media
  - nonce
  - title

## Practice

Finish styling all paragraph elements within the document to have text color as `gray`:

```html
???
 ??? {
     ???: ???;
    }
??? 
  
<p> 
  Random text
</p>
```

* `<style>`
* `p`
* `color`
* `gray`
* `</style>`
* `<paragraph>`
* `</paragraph>`
