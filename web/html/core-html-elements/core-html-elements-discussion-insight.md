## Content

Now that you've learned some HTML, it's time to try it out!

Can you write HTML code for a webpage that would display:
- The largest heading containing the title of the page
- An image of any size. To be nice to your viewers add an alternative text message in case the image cannot load.
- One paragraph with information about the page.
- A link to another website

It's up to you to choose the title, the image, what the contents of those paragraphs will be, as well as their color.

Here's one example of how the page can look:

For bonus points try and style the paragraphs and/or headings in a different color.

If you're not sure what to do, check out this footnote[1].

When you're ready, leave a comment here with your submission. If you don't want to participate, you can always check the comment section to see what the other users come up with.

## Footnotes
[1: Hints]

The heading should contain a title describing your page.

If you use multiple headings, make sure they are in descending order.

The paragraphs, the image, and the link can be on any position.

You can style each paragraph/heading individually, or you can style them by adding a property at the top of your page.

The link should have appropriate text explaining what is linked.

You can also add the link in the paragraph.
