# Containers

---
## Content

A container in Webflow is just another layout box element. However, a container cannot be nested with other containers.

Containers are used to group a bunch of elements together for easier positioning, styling, text editing and more.

By default, all elements in a container are centered relative to the window they're being viewed on.

For instance, let's say we have 4 text elements and an image element all positioned one under the other.

Example without a container:

![default-no-container](https://img.enkipro.com/73fe01c37bb4e50c24a3516dd84447ec.png)

The image above is how 4 default paragraphs and a default empty image would look like upon creation. 

Now, if we add them to a container:

![added-in-container](https://img.enkipro.com/7b5bfecd9ea7ec3641a19fd89681251b.png)

we can apply a layout to all 5 elements by editing their top-level container element.

After applying positioning to the container without editing any of the elements inside.

Next to just positioning elements, containers can be used to apply styles, keep certain content of a web page together, have specific text styles per containers and much more.

To create a container is the same as creating a section element. There are 3 ways:

1. Click anywhere on the canvas and left-click a container element from the `Add Elements` panel to add it to the previously clicked position.

2. Drag and drop a container element from the `Add Elements` panel anywhere on the canvas.

3. Drag and drop a container element from the `Add Elements` panel to a position in the `Navigator`.
