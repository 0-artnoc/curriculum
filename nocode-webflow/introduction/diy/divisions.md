# Divisions

---
## Content

A division, or a Div block, is one of the most used elements when creating a web page.

A Div element is the most basic element that can be used for many things.

You can use Div's to group elements, create space between other elements, style elements differently per div block, you can also nest div blocks and have different stylings and other properties per nested div block. However, without CSS, Divs have no effect on the content within them.

There are 3 ways to create a div element:

- Click anywhere on the canvas and left-click a div element from the `Add Elements` panel to add it to the previously clicked position.

- Drag and drop a div element from the `Add Elements` panel anywhere on the canvas.

- Drag and drop a div element from the `Add Elements` panel to a position in the `Navigator`.

To add an element to a div, you can drag and drop it in the `Navigator`.

You can also use Div blocks to easily duplicate content.

If you duplicate a Div element, the duplicate keeps all of the styling and properties applied to it as well as any content, styling, and positioning of all the elements within the Div element.

Also, if you duplicate a div block you can edit the styling of one of the divs and it will automatically update any existing duplicate regardless of the page it is on. 

This is because when you duplicate a div, the duplicate keeps the same class name and any styling changes made to elements with the same class name are also be applied to any duplicate with the same class name.

This is good if you have the same div on a couple of pages. You can duplicate the divs and if you edit the styling on one of them, all the other will be updated instantly.

These changes only apply to the styling, editing the content, like changing the text will not update all other divs of the same class. 

To make sure you don't edit all existing duplicates when you duplicate a div you need to change its class name.

To learn more about the HTML and CSS code aspects of divs you can check out our HTML and Styling courses.

Here is an example of a div element with the Column and container elements created in the previous insights:

The same div with a simple alignment to the center and positioning applied.

As you can see in the first image, by default the content was everywhere with no margins nor paddings and it was spread out across the full width of the page. Using the Div element we can make all the content within the Div follow the format we want, just by formating the `Div`.
