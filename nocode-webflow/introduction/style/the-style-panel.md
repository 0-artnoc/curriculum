# The Style Panel

---
## Content

The Style panel is used for styling any element. The Style panel can be used to edit an elements layout, spacing, positioning, color, effects and more.

The Style panel is located on the right side of the `Designer`. 

You can also use the Style panel to create new classes, edit previously created ones as well as change any elements class at any time.

The Style panel can also be used to edit the styling of your webpage depending on if it is viewed on a Tablet, Phone, Computer or any other specific pixel size.

The Style panel is always active and responds to the selected element.

To use it, all you have to do is select an existing element. 

After selecting an element, any changes you make on the Style panel will be applied to the selected element.

**Note:** The Style panel can also be used to apply effects to multiple elements at once. 

To do so, we need to create classes. If more than 1 element has the same class name, we can use the Style panel to apply changes to all elements of the same class through one of those elements. More on classes in the next insight.

The Style panel is divided into several sections with numerous options inside each one.
