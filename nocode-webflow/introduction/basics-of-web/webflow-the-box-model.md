# The Box Model

---
## Content

The box model is used to describe the layout of the web.

Essentially, all elements you create are treated as boxes and each box can be nested or grouped with another box.

For instance, you can create a box for an image and a box for a caption for that image. 

Then you can take both of those boxes and add them in a `container`. 

Let's say we have these 2 boxes(`image` and `text`)

![example-box-no-container](https://img.enkipro.com/682e2a960804e3f034c123869a5c44eb.png)

We can put these 2 boxes(elements) inside a container. If we want to move or edit either of the boxes, we can do it through the container.

If you move the container, all boxes nested inside it will also be moved.

You can use the container to edit the positioning of those 2 boxes inside it, as well as animation, styling and more.

The box model has a responsive design. This means that the box size and position depends on the resolution it is being viewed on. 

Since everything on Webflow is customizable, you can set your boxes to be of fixed or relative size, or auto-adjustable based on resolution.
