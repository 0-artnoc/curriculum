# Webflow Dependencies

## Content

To use Webflow, all you need is an account.

Webflow has a free to use version called "Starter Plan", where you can use a variety of their tools without paying for anything. However, a lot of more powerful tools are only available in the premium version.

The free to use version is essentially there so customers can review and test the program for as long as they want without spending any money. You can even make a responsive website for free and host a prototype version on their domain. However, you cannot make it live or download the code without paying.

To make an account, you can either click on any of these buttons or go to their [sign up page](https://webflow.com/dashboard/signup):

The sign up page will looke more or less like this:

![create-account-options](https://img.enkipro.com/16703b84a5a0810449a81f6b1ff3c3be.png)

You can either either choose to create your account through Google or by filling in all the required information yourself.

Next, you will be greeted with a couple of questions so they can tailor the experience to your needs and expertise.

After completing the on-screen steps, depending on what you chose, you will get a screen similar to this one:

![new-account-first-project-screen](https://img.enkipro.com/91d31e018c219cedc37034a48ddc32a5.png)

And you are ready to get started.
