# What is Webflow?

---
## Content

Webflow is a very powerful and unique responsive website design tool introduced in 2013. With this tool, you don't need to know how to write the code (or how websites are made) to create a fully functional website.

In Webflow, you use something called the `Designer` in which you drag & drop components to create and customize your website. You never see any code.

Although you never see any code, you can always export the HTML, CSS and JavaScript of your website. Anything you create visually with their online tool will automatically create the code for you.

Furthermore, there are a lot of pre-made layouts and templates you can use, free and premium, both of which are 100% customizable and can be tailored to your desired needs.

This way of creating websites significantly reduces the time for the `idea → design → production`.

On top of creating websites, Webflow provides hosting and shop (online payments) services.
