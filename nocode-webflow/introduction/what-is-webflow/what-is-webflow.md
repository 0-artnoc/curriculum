# What is `Webflow`?

---
## Content

`Webflow` is a very powerful and unique responsive website design tool introduced in 2013. 

With `Webflow`, you don't need to know how websites are made or even how to write the code to create a fully functional website.

`Webflow` offers a feature called `Designer` where you don't even need to see the code to create and customize your website. 

With `Webflow`, you can export the `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript` code that is automatically generated when you design your website.

Anything you create visually with their online tool automatically creates the code for you.

Also, there are a lot of pre-made layouts and templates you can use, free and premium, both of which are 100% customizable and can be tailored to your desired needs.

This way of creating websites significantly reduces the time for the `idea → design → production`.

Next to creating websites on their platform they also work as a hosting platform.

You can also use `Webflow` to create monthly payments through their webpage to bill the users using your projects.
