# Cascading Style Sheets

---
## Content

`CSS` or **Cascading Style Sheets** is a `stylesheet` language used to describe the presentation of an HTML, XML, or XHTML document. It's used to provide styling for text, images, & links.

In short, `CSS` is used to create responsive layouts, animations, styling text, and positioning containers. By applying `CSS`, you add the look and feel that you'd like to your websites.

However, `CSS` is not good for inserting media, creating links, and it also doesn't allow math expressions and database storage.

With Webflow, you don't need to type your code for margins, paddings, or any styling and animation. You can do all of that through the `Designer` and the code will be written and edited automatically as you edit each element of your webpage.

To learn more about `CSS` you can visit our `Web -> Styling` course.
