# Navigation

---
## Content

All Websites have a form of navigation to make it easier for users to navigate through their webpage.

For this purpose, Webflow provides a powerful element called `Navbar`.

`Navbar` is a pre-designed navigation element which by default has a place for a logo, a couple of navigation links and an invisible button that is shown only when the screen size becomes to small for the whole navigation bar, like on a phone or a tablet. `Navbar`s are the only elements you can place nav links in.

Example of an empty `Navbar`:

Example of a `Navbar` with an `<Enki/>` logo and 1 more link section:

To add a `Navbar` to your webpage:

- Click anywhere on the Canvas and left-click a `Navbar` element from the `Add Elements` panel to add it to the previously clicked position.

- Drag and drop a `Navbar` element from the `Add Elements` panel anywhere on the canvas.

- Drag and drop a `Navbar` element from the `Add Elements` panel to a position in the `Navigator`.

To add a new link element to your `Navbar`, select the `Navbar` and add a new link in the `Navbar Settings` panel on the right side of the screen.

You can also add a new link by copying and pasting an existing one.

Above the `Add link` button there is a `Link Settings` section. The 5 image buttons are used to determine what kind of link you want. After choosing an option the bottom part of the `Link Settings` will change. 

For instance, choosing the first `URL` button will give a placeholder for a custom link with a checkbox button to "Open in new tab".
