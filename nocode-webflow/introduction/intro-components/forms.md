# Forms

---
## Content

Components are elements with pre-designed functions.

Forms are used to represent a section of a document that contains interactive controls for a user to input information, like input text fields, checkboxes, and radio buttons.

Forms are one of the most-used components.

To create a simple form go to the `Add Element` panel and under forms select `Form Block`.

You can either drag and drop it on the Canvas or `Navigator`, or you can first click on a position on the Canvas and then left-click the `Form Block` in the `Add element` panel.

How It looks on the Canvas:

In the `Navigator`:

All forms on `Webflow` are fully customizable.

After creating a `Form Block` you can remove or add any element to it. 

**Note:** You cannot add a form element anywhere outside of a form, but you can add a non-form element, like a photo, to a form. 

If we tried to add a form element, in this case, a label, outside of the form, we would get this error:

If we wanted to add or remove an element we can do it both from the Canvas and the `Navigator`.

If we wanted to edit the settings of a form element, we need to either double click the element on the Canvas or select it either in the `Navigator` or Canvas and edit the settings on the Right side panel.

Double-clicking will give you the green highlighted settings. To view, all settings select the 2nd panel on the right side.
