# Container Philosophy

---

## Content

A great analogy for Docker containers can be found in the shipping industry. Before shipping containers were standardized, it was difficult to transport things across the world. Now, with advent of standardized containers, you only have to rent or buy a container and pack it with your things (in a way which makes sure not to damage the container). As the containers are standardised, people know how to handle them and therefore donâ€™t need to adjust their contents too much.

Docker containers are meant to be **immutable** and **ephemeral**.

This allows us to build an immutable infrastructure where we only start, stop and deploy containers but never change them.
An update is done by re-deploying a new container, not by changing an existing one.

We create containers using *images* (more on this to come).
