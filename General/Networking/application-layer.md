**Application Layer** is the top most layer of the `OSI` model. It pays an *important role* in the *interaction* between users and user applications.

In *particular* an application layer **protocol** defines:
- The type of the message
- The syntax of the various message types
- The semantics of the fields
- Communication rules  

Best known **protocols**:

**SMTP(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)** is the `TCP/IP` protocol that supports electronic mail on the internet. In the client/server model:
- **SMTP** has a *client side* which executes on the sender's server side and a *server side* which executes on the recipient's server.
- Both of them run on every email server.

**TELNET(Terminal Network)** is a *client-server application* that enables users to log onto *remote machine* and lets the user access any application program on a remote computer.

**FTP(File Transfer Protocol)** is the standard *mechanism* provided by `TCP/IP` for *copying* a file from one host to another. It is build on a **client-server** architecture and uses separate *control* and *data* connections between the two devices.

**MIME(Multipurpose Internet Mail Extention)** is an extension of **SMTP** enabling transfer of *multimedia messages*.

**POP(Post Office Protocol)** is a protocol used by a *mail server* in conjunction with **SMTP** to receive and holds mail for *hosts*.
