## Content

Both `TCP` and `UDP` are protocols that deal with sending bits of data(packets) over a network.

Used together with **IP** which deals with the "where", these protocol define "how" the data is sent.

- `TCP` is **connection oriented** â€“ once a connection is established, data can be sent *to* and *from* both parties.
- `UDP` is a simpler, connectionless Internet protocol. Multiple messages are sent as packets in chunks using `UDP`.

#### TCP

Transmission Control Protocol is the most widely used protocol over the Internet mostly due to its *reliability*.
Its purpose is to ensure that all **packets** are received as uncorrupted files.

To communicate, a `TCP` connection between two devices must be established. This connection enables sending data in **ordered** chunks (packets). If some packets are lost along the way, the device **receiving** data can ask for them again.
After both computers are aware that the transfer is over (there are no packets missing), the connection is *dropped*.

As a consequence, `TCP` transfers are **slower**, but error correction is ensured.

Common protocols that work on top of `TCP` are: **HTTP**, **HTTPS**, **FTM**, **SMTP** and **Telnet**. We will get back to these in the following insights.

#### UDP

User Datagram Protocol, on the other hand, was designed for **fast data transmission**.

When `datagrams` (packets) are released into the **network** there is no way of telling wether they reach the destination. Data can arrive out of order, duplicated or not arrive at all.

The simplicity of `UDP` reduces overhead[1] from the protocol and can be adequate for some applications such as real-time media streams or broadcasts.

Protocols such as **DHCP** and **VOIP** work on top of `UDP`.

Overhead, in Computer Science, means any form of excess or indirect computation, time, memory, bandwidth or other resources required to complete a specific task.
