## Content

**Computer Networking's** main purpose is to enable several devices to communicate with each other by sharing and exchanging resources between them.

There is a well known classification of the *computer networks* based on the geographical area they cover:
- `LAN` a local area network, typically interconnects hosts that are up to a few of kilometres apart
- `MAN` a metropolitan area network, typically interconnects hosts that are up to a few hundred kilometres apart
- `WAN` a wide area network, typically interconnects hosts that are anywhere on the Earth

Network computer devices which originate, route and terminate the data within a network are called **network nodes**.

Usually, nodes include **hosts** such as *PCs*, *servers*, *phones*, but *network hardware*[1] as well. Two such devices are said to be *networked* when one of them is able to *exchange information* with the other.

Keep in mind that nodes can be connected by cable, most commonly the **Ethernet cable**, wirelessly via radio waves or even with the help satellites.     

The largest and most known computer network is the **Internet** (or World Wide Web). This world-wide system of interconnected smaller networks enables millions of devices to communicate with each other.

## Footnotes

[1:network hardware]
These are physical devices which are required for communication and interaction between devices on a computer network. Specifically, they mediate data in a computer network.

Such examples are:
- routers
- modems
- switches
