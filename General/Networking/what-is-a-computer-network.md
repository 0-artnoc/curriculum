## Content

**Computer Networking's** main purpose is to enabe severel devices communicate with each other, being able to share resources.

There is a well known classification of the *computer networks* based on the geographical area they cover:
- `LAN` a local area network, typically interconnects hosts that are up to a few of killometers apart.
- `MAN` a metropolitan area network, typically interconnects hosts that are up to a few hundred killometers apart.
- `WAN` a wide area network, typically interconnects hosts that are anywhere on the Earth.

Network computer devices which originate,route and terminate the data are called **network nodes**. Usually nodes include **hosts** such as *PCs*, *servers*, *phone* as well as *network hardware*. Two such devices are said to be *networked* when one of this devices is able to **exchange information** with the other device.      

The most common network communication known is **Internet**. Internet is a world-wide system of interconnected computer networks. Any *computer* in internet is identified by an unique `IP`. IP address is a *unique* set of numbers which identifies a computer's *location*. A special *computer* **DNS(Domain Name Server)** is used to give name to the `IP` address such that users can locate computers by a name.
