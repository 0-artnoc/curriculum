## Content

**Computer networking**, constantly evolving, accumulated over the time a lot of technical jargon that can become intimidating when dwelling into the technicalities of this field.

It's better to understand technologies and common terms used by convention when taking a deeper look.

**Firewall**

A firewall is a network security system that monitors *incoming and outgoing* network traffic and decides whether to *allow or block* specific traffic based on a defined set of security rules.

This system can be a software program, a piece of hardware of a combination of both. A firewall is usually used for:
- blocking access to **private networks** (intranet)
- screening out malicious data that try to reach your computer over the Internet


**Proxy**

A **proxy server** serves as a hub through which Internet requests are processed. It acts like an intermediate between you and a targeted host.

A proxy will make the requests you want instead of you and will return the response back to you. It can be used for various applications such as:
- bypassing parental filters
- accessing location-blocked content
- providing a layer of anonymity

**VPN**

Short for *Virtual Private Network*, `VPN`s extend a private network across a public network, such as the Internet.

Nowadays, they serve as a security and anonymity mechanism when browsing public networks.

**ISP**

Short for *Internet Service Provided*, the ISP is usually the company that provides you access to the Internet.

**Gateway**

A gateway is a device that routes traffic between networks. For example, your home router is your gateway between `LAN` and `WAN`.

**MAC address**

Also known as *physical address**, this is a unique identifier designed to differentiate devices on a network.
