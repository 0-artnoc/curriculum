## Content

Both `bandwidth`  and `throughput` are metrics used to describe the ability of to transfer data over the network by a device.

However, there is a big difference between the two:
 - `bandwidth`  refers to the **maximum** possible speed at which a device *can* transfer data
 - `throughput` refers to the **actual** speed at which a device transfers data

This distinction is relevant between **ISPs** [1] usually advertise their bandwidth which is often higher than the throughput you will receive.

These metrics are measured and usually expressed in bits per seconds (`bps`).

 Modern networks are much faster and therefore have their speeds measured in million of bits per second - megabits per second (`Mbps`) or in billion of bits per second - gigabits per second (`Gbps`)
