We have witnessed an exponential growth of **computer networks** since introduction, more and more people using them every day.

It stands to reason that their complexity increased as well in favour of automated, faster, more reliable and secure communication.

Therefore, interacting with **networks** can intimidate numerous users.

Luckily, most operating systems, counting **Linux**, **OSX**, **Windows** and even **Chrome OS** provide a variety of utilities to make these interactions easier.

These will prove extremely useful when having to troubleshoot, optimise or get various information about **networks**.

In addition, getting to know how the *tools of the trade* work will give you a better insight of how **networks** work in the end and vice-versa.

Be it for entirely informational purposes or for troubleshooting, it's important to know the tools of the trade to fully understand computer networks.

The most known and used utilities include:

- `ping` - tests the availability of remote hosts by echoing a packet to the destination
- `traceroute` - provides information about the path of a packet towards a destination
- `ipconfig/ifconfig` - configures network interfaces
- `nslookup` - looks up IP addresses linked to a domain
- `netstat` - provides statistics about networks
- `route` - shows and manipulates the **IP Routing Table**[1]

## Footnotes

[1:IP Routing Table]
A routing table is a set of rules, often viewed in table format, that is used to determine where data packets traveling over an Internet Protocol (`IP`) network will be directed.

All IP-enabled devices, including routers and switches, use routing tables.
