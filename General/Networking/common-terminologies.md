In this insight, you will be presented with *terminology* specific to **computer networks** that you will encounter in the workouts to follow.

`DNS`(Domain Name Service)
It provides a means to attach a name to the `IP` address, making it easier for us to request resources.
Basically `DNS` works like the agenda implemented in our mobile phones. It *maps* a name to each phone number, so when we need to calla person, it is easier to search his name then the whole phone number.

Example:
`www.enki.com -->domain
 123.255.1.34 -->ip`

`Server`
It is represented by a **computer** or **application** which hosts a service.

`Client`
Usually refers to a computer or application which uses the service.

`Firewall`
It is a special type of `server`. A specific **port** number is assigned to all data transmitted through the **internet**,  depending on the type of data sent.
A firewall manages which ports are open for inbound and outbound traffic. There are also firewalls capable of **routing** specific ports to specific
outbound and inbound `IP` addresses.

`Proxy`
It is another *specialized* server. Whereas `firewall` handles opening/closing **ports** and routing, the `proxy` controls the way **data** is processed on the ports.
`VPN`(Virtual Private Network)
It is a way of *joining* two **networks** which are not *physically* connected. This happens by creating a `VPN Tunnel` to link the two networks.

`VoIP`(Voice over Internet Protocol)
This is an service that has been *growing and developing* quite a bit *as of late*. > It started off as a simple protocol, but since the mobile industry skyrocketed, constant improvements have been added. For example, a few years ago, `VoIP` wasn't able to support a video call.
