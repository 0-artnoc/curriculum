As any other scientific domain, *computer networking* has some predefined **terminologies** too.

`DNS`(Domain Name Service)
It provides a means to attach a name to the `IP` address, making it easier for us to request resources.
Basically `DNS` works like the agenda implemented in our mobile phones. It *maps* a name to each phone number, so when we need to call
a person, it is easier to search his name then the whole phone number.

`Server`
It is represented by a **computer** or **application** which hosts a service.

`Client`
Usually refers to a computer or application which **receives** the service.

`Firewall`
It is a special type of `server`. A specific **port** number is assigned to all data transmitted through the **internet**, based on the *data type*.
A firewall manages which ports are open for inbound and outbound traffic. There are also firewalls capable of **routing** specific ports to specific
outbound and inbound `IP` addresses.

`Proxy`It is another *specialized* type of server. Whereas `firewall` is managing opening/closing of **ports** and where specific ports are routed; the `proxy` controls
how the **data** is used within those *ports*.

`VPN`(Virtual Private Network)
It is a way of *joining* two **networks** which are not *phisically* connected. This happens by creating a `VPN Tunnel` to link the two networks.

`VoIP`(Voice over Internet Protocol)
This is an emerging service that has been *growing and developing* quite a bit *as of late*. In it's beginning `VoIP` didn't need many **updates**, but as these days mobile phones industry has *rocketed*, constant improvements are brought to it. For example, a few years ago, `VoIP` wasn't able to support a video call.
