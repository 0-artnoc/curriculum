## Content

Every time you want to make two or more devices talk with each other you need to use **networks**.

A **network** consists of devices that are linked through varying technologies[1] such that they are able to communicate.

Now, exactly as in real life, when you want two parties to communicate properly you need to follow some rules. Among networks, different sets of rules are called **protocols**.

You have more than sure encountered and used some of the following **protocols**:
- `IP` - used to uniquely identify computers (*hosts*)
- `FTP`[2] - standard protocol for file transfer between two hosts
- `HTTP` - key protocol for data transfer across the *Internet*
- `SMTP` - used for mail transfer

When accessing a webpage you can easily spot the **protocol** in use from the **URL**:
```
https://enki.com
// here the HTTPS protocol is used
```

In human communication we can think about the *English language* as a **protocol**. It defines some rules that make sure the parties understand each other.

However, other rules, and therefore other **protocols** are need. For example, two persons shouldn't speak at the same time because information might get lost.

In the same way, computer networks will use multiple **protocols** that are hierarchically organised on different layers[3].

##FOOTNOTES

[1:further information]
Technologies that allow the *linking* between computers in a **network** include:
- cables
- telephone lines
- radio waves
- satellites
- infrared light beams

[2:fact]
`FTP` was firstly published by Abhay Bhushan in **1971**, making it **45** years old.

[3:Network Layers]
According to the **OSI model** (used for computer systems communication standardisation) there are 7 layers of *networking protocols*.

These layers range from a low-level **Physical Layer** to a high-level **Application Layer**.

Any protocol can be pinpointed to a specific layer. For example, the `HTTP` protocol is situated on the **Session Layer** that manages continous exchange of information.

## Practice

Where can we find out what protocols are in use from
??? ?

* `URL`
* the webpage
* the server
