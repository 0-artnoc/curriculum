An **IP** address is an unique identifier *assigned* to a computer when connected to a network.

Chances are that while reading this you are connected to *the Internet*, a global, huge **computer network** that makes possible the communication between billions of devices[1].

Now, to make *communication* possible, you need a way to distinguish yourself among the  astonishing number of devices around you.

Here, the *IP[2] address* comes in handy by uniquely identifying devices in a **network**. This is similar to the way real-life *postal addresses* identify our houses.

There's a big chance you have already encountered them in the following form[3]:

```
//exmaple IP adress
25.255.0.1
```

With that being the shorhand notations.The actual format of an IP address is:
```
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
```
where `xxx` represents a number between `0` and `255`[4].

In reality, things are a little bit more complicated, with the IP spliting into two categories :
 - **static** - hardcoded and constant
 - **dynamic** - frequently changing, being assigned by another device

# Fun fact

Keep in mind that IP addresses are the implementation of the `TCP/IP`[5] protocol stack.
Alternatives such as `AppleTalk` exist, but `TCP/IP` proved superior and became the standard.

## Footnotes

[1:trivia]
Garner, Inc. estimates that there will be almost **21 billion** devices connected to the internet by year `2020`.

[2:Notation]
`IP` is the acronym for **Internet Protocol**.

[3:Clarification]
This form is specific to the fourth version of *Internet Protocol*, called `IPv4`, accounting for `93%` of internet protocole.

In addition to IPv4, the sixth version of the Internet Protocol, called IPv6, is also in use.

The syntax of the latter is:
```
xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx
```
where `xxxx` stands for a hexadecimal number.

[4:Possibilities]
The `IPv4` format allows the existence of `2^32` different IP addresses.

[5:Further information]
`TCP/IP` represents the most common stack of protocols used by computer networks.

Its name comes from the most famous protocols in use:
 - `TCP`, short for **Transmission Control Protocol**
 - `IP` short for **Internet Protocol**

## Practice

`IP` can behave either as static or as ??? .

* `dynamic`
* `static`
* `constant`

---
## Revision

`IP`'s job is to help ??? devices connected to a network.

* `identify`
* `use`
* `prepare`
