# More Complex Arithmetic Operators

---
## Content

Python supports the `**` arithmetic operator, which multiplies a number to the power of another.

Example 1:
```python
>>> 2 ** 4
16
```
This code executes as 2 to the power of 4.

Example 2:
```python
>>> -3 ** 4
-81
```
This code executes as -(3 to the power of 4). If you want to learn more about the order in which operations are executed make sure to check out the resources for this insight.

Python also supports the modulo operator, `%`, which is used to return the integer remainder of a division sum.

Here's this operator in use:
```python
>>> 14 % 3
2
```
14 divided by 3 equals 4 remainder 2. The modulo operator returns the remainder, 2.
