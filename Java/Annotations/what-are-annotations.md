## Content

Annotations is a way of describing the code without changing its' functionality in most cases. We can think of annotations as comments for compiler or JVM.

//COPYRIGHT ISSUES
The three most common purposes of annotations are:
 - Information for the compiler — Annotations can be used by the compiler to detect errors or suppress warnings.
 - Compile-time and deployment-time processing — Software tools can process annotation information to generate code, XML files, and so forth.
 - Runtime processing — Some annotations are available to be examined at runtime.

Every annotation starts with the `@` sign which is followed by the name starting with a capital letter i.e.: `@Override`
