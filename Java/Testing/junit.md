**JUnit** is one of the main *unit testing frameworks* written for Java. Testing means verifying that the application as a whole or small parts of it (*units*) behave as expected.

So, testing with *JUnit* means checking small snippets of code through **assertions**. They are used to make sure that the logic behind a piece of code is not flawed. However, as E. W. Dijkstra once said, *testing shows the presence, not the absence of bugs*.

Unit testing comprises:
 - *manual testing*: running each test case by hand
 - *automated testing*: using tools that bundle tests and run them all at once, called test suites

 A single test is called a *test case*.
