# What Are Filters

---
## Content

Filters are used to temporarily hide a portion of the data in your spreadsheet. This allows you to deliberately expose or analyze only a specific (unfiltered) part of your data.

**Note:** Any filter you apply to your spreadsheet will be visible to anyone with access to your spreadsheet. Depending on their permissions, they can also edit the filter.

You can also create specific filter view links when you want to create different filters for different people regarding the same spreadsheet.

Filters are used for sorting data in ascending or descending order, larger than or smaller than a value, between two values, containing a part of a string, only display specific values and much more.

For instance, let us say we have the following data:

![spreadsheet-without-filter](https://img.enkipro.com/3b9822e2a460ad19dfddd8dda3bd2dd9.png)

To create a filter on one column:

![singe-column-filter](https://img.enkipro.com/db56d82d1791e0bd8378e2bfba4d2a42.gif)

To create filters on multiple columns:

![multiple-column-filter](https://img.enkipro.com/c185b4b3c2a11a803074371cd5a60a47.gif)

**Note:** You can create filters on any column and any row.

If you create a filter on a column, all currently available cells in that column will be affected. The same goes for creating a filter on a row, all currently available columns will be affected. 

Creating filters on rows:

To create a filter only on a specific range of cells, you need to select those cells and then go to `"data" > "create a filter"`

![specific-range-filter](https://img.enkipro.com/ce62af66247d6d80e4838b7e1c321e6d.gif)

Now that we know how to create a filter, let's use the spreadsheet above and add a filter to only display people who are older than `40` in `ascending` order.

When you create a filter, it's blank at the start. You need to select how you want to filter your data inside the filter.

Press on the 3 green lines highlighted below:

![open-filter](https://img.enkipro.com/cd6317837dcecf514fe4b90d0b338efb.png)

This will open a popup window:

![conditions](https://img.enkipro.com/3e47d81491c9596077d5f7d5adcbcc7e.png)

In the `Filter by condition` section, select `greater than or equal to` and input `40` into the field below.

![selected-condition](https://img.enkipro.com/8b440f7fe255ffb051aba6ec6782ca4f.png)

Our table will now look like this:
