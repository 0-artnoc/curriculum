# What Are Filters

---
## Content

Filters are used to temporarily hide a portion of the data in your spreadsheet. This allows you to deliberately expose or analyze only a specific (unfiltered) part of your data.

**Note:** Any filter you apply to your spreadsheet will be visible to anyone with access to your spreadsheet. Depending on their permissions, they can also edit the filter.

You can also create specific filter view links when you want to create different filters for different people regarding the same spreadsheet.

Filters are used for sorting data in ascending or descending order, larger than or smaller than a value, between two values, containing a part of a string, only display specific values and much more.

Consider the following data:

To create a filter on one column, you have to first select the column in question followed by going to the `Data` tab and pressing `Create a filter`:

To create filters on multiple columns you should follow the same procedure, the only difference is selecting multiple columns instead of one.

If you create a filter on a column, all currently available cells in that column will be affected.

To create a filter only on a specific range of cells, instead of selecting the column you select the range of cells you want to apply the filter then. After that, follow the same procedure.
