# Why are charts useful?

---
## Content

A good example of why charts are useful is because they can be used to detect patterns and understand results in a more clear way.

They are good for understanding large quantities of data that would otherwise be difficult to individually analyze. A single chart can represent thousands of data points.

Each type of chart also "tells a story".

This is because visualizations can quickly demonstrate patterns and allow us to draw conclusions and determine any negative or positive outcomes about our data.
