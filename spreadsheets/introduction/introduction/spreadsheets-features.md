# Spreadsheet features

---
## Content

Spreadsheets were designed for work with numerical data. You can perform both simple calculations like multiplication, or complex ones which include *multiple functions* at the same time.

There are many *formulas* that can be used to organize, calculate, or find the data that you need. You can even set up formulas to change the color of certain cells based on calculations or conditions.

After transforming your data, you can create *graphs or charts* to represent or visualize the results more effectively.

Pivot tables are another important feature of spreadsheets. These can be used on very large data sets to extract or aggregate the data resulting in an improved view.

This is just some of what spreadsheets can do. We'll cover all the main features in this course.
