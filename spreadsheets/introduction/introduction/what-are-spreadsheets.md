# What Are Spreadsheets

---
## Content

A spreadsheet is an electronic document in which data can be recorded, analyzed or used for calculations.

A spreadsheets is made up of rows and columns of cells that form a table. A cell is an intersection between a column and a row.

Rows are marked with numbers (starting from 1), columns are marked with letters (starting from A) and each cell can be referenced with its letter-number pair (starting from A1).

There are many spreadsheet tools with the most popular ones being Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets. The first Windows version of Excel was released in 1987 whereas the first version for Mac was released in 1985. However, the very first version of spreadsheet tools was called Multiplan and has been around since 1982.
