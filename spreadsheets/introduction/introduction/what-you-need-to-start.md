# Spreadsheet Tool Options

---
## Content

There are many available options for spreadsheet tools. As you probably know, the most popular ones are Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel.

The most accessible tool is [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/) since it's free. All you need is a Google account.

[Microsoft Excel](https://products.office.com/en-gb/excel) is a paid spreadsheet tool that can either be bought as a one-time purchase or as a subscription.

There are [other spreadsheet tools available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadsheet#Web_based_spreadsheets), with most of the functionality similar to Google Sheets and Excel. 

For most of this topic, we'll be using Google Sheets.
