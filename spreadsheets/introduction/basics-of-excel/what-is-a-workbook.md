# What is a workbook?

---
## Content

A workbook is a single file containing one or more worksheets (sheets).

When you create a new workbook, by default, you get 1 worksheet. More sheets can be added at any time.

The main difference between a workbook and a worksheet (sheet) is that you can have many worksheets inside a single workbook, but not vice versa. The workbook is the main file and it can contain as many worksheets as needed.

A worksheet is a grid-like table sheet comprised of rows and columns.

To create a new workbook in Microsoft Excel you need to go to:
 `File > New > *blank workbook*`

The Google docs version is almost the same except instead of a "blank workbook" it's called "spreadsheet".
Both "Workbook" and "Spreadsheet" mean the same thing. 
 `File > New > *spreadsheet*`

**Note:** You don't have to create a blank workbook every time. There are pre-made templates you can use, which we will discuss in the next workout.

The maximum worksheets a workbook can have depends on the version of Excel and the memory of your computer.
