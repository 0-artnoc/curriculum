# What is Sheet?

---
## Content

A sheet (or a worksheet) is a single page of a workbook/spreadsheet/folder.

It consists of rows (usually marked with numbers) and columns (usually marked with letters).

The maximum number of rows, columns, and cells a sheet can have solely depends on the spreadsheet tool you are using.

For instance, in Google Sheets you can have a maximum of 500,000 rows, 18,278 columns or 5,000,000 cells. As soon as the cell count reaches 5 million, you cannot make any more new rows or columns.

To add a new sheet, go to the bottom left corner of the spreadsheet and press on the `+` sign.

Right-clicking a sheet opens a menu where you can rename it, move it, duplicate it, delete it and more.
