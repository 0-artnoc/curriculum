# Change numbers to negative

---
## Content

Here is a tip when you have a large table where you forgot to put a negative sign on several numbers.

Let's say we have this table:

![simple-table](https://img.enkipro.com/c9510da2fb937ddd1256fedc0107cbea.png)

When creating it, we forgot to put the 2nd column of numbers as negative.

To change them all to negative, we select the cells we want to change.

In Windows, you would have to press `CTRL + H` while in Mac OS you would have to press `COMMAND + SHIFT + H`.

Next, enter `^` in the `Find` field, `-` in the `Replace` field, tick the `Search using regular expressions` field and press the `Replace all`.
