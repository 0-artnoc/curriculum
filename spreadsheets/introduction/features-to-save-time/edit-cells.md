# Edit cells

---
## Content

Editing an empty cell is as simple as clicking on it and typing.

However, if you have a populated cell that you want to edit, just clicking on it once and starting to type would delete everything in the cell and replace it with the newly typed content.

Example:

As you can see in the above video, when we click on the cell we can see its content in the `formula bar`[1].

There are 3 ways to edit a cell without replacing all of its content.

- Double click the cell.
- Select the cell and press the `F2` shortcut to open the `formula bar`.
- Select the cell and navigate to the `formula bar`.

## Practice

What would happen if you click once on a populated cell and start writing?

???

* Delete the content of the cell with what you just wrote.
* Add the newly written information at the end of the content of the cell.

## Footnotes
[1:formula bar]
The formula bar is where you can see the contents of a cell as well as make any changes. What you see in the formula bar might not be what is displayed in the cell.

For instance, if you had this formula `=SUM(A1:B1)` in the cell `C1`, the formula bar would show you the formula `=SUM(A1:B1)` whilst the cell the formula is located in would give you the result of the function.
