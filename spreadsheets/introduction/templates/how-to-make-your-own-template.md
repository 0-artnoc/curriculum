# How to make your own template 

---
## Content

Now that we know how to use predefined templates, it's time to learn how to make one. 

There is a difference when creating a template in Office Excel and in Google Spreadsheets.

In this insight, we will discuss the Google Docs spreadsheet version.

(Longer and more detailed guides for both Office Excel and Google Sheets are located in the links section)

One thing to note when creating your own template in Google Docs is that there are public and privates templates. 

The public template, anyone can use and see any updates you make to it, whereas the private one, only you can see and use.

### How to create a private template

To create a private template, first, you need to create either a blank spreadsheet or one from a template. Edit the spreadsheet as much as you want, and when you are ready for it to be your new template, save it with a name you will remember. For instance, "My schedule template"

When you want to use your template, you need to go to your previously made documents, which is the home page of docs.google.com/spreadsheets. Now find your "My schedule template", right-click on it and make a copy, now use that copy as your template without ruining the original file. When done, just save it under a different name.

### How to create a public template

To create a public template is a bit different. 

The first step is exactly the same.

After you create your template, you need to open `File > Publish to web`.

This will open a new tab called "Publish to the web" where you can choose how to publish your template.

To publish it as a template all you have to do is pick either the "Entire Document" or a specific sheet/s and choose the "OpenDocument spreadsheet". 

After you press publish, you will get a link to the newly published template that you and anyone else can have access to.
