# What is a template?

---
## Content

A template is a predesigned sheet with predefined formulas and formatting.

Templates are very useful because they save a lot of time. 

You can use templates to instantly create a "To-Do" list, or a wedding planner, an invoice, a calendar and much more.

These templates allow users to take advantage of Excel's power even though they haven't yet learned all the formulas and formatting required to do from scratch.

Moreover, you can even create your custom ones.

To create a new spreadsheet from a template go to:

This will open a new tab called "Template gallery" where you can choose the template you like.

**Note:** Both Office Excel and Google Sheets have many powerful templates users can use. However, if you do not like what they offer you can always find a ton more online.

For instance,[this website](https://www.goskills.com/Excel/Articles/Free-Excel-templates) has 7 different categories with numerous templates in each that you can download for free.
