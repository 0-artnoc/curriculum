There are a lot of popular and widely used templates in Excel.

Some of these are the `invoice` and `expense report` ones.

### Invoice template

An invoice is a document issued by a seller to the buyer. It provides details about a sale or products, including the quantities, costs, and any special terms.


The invoice template:

This template can save you a lot of time when you need to send your invoice every month.
Instead of creating one from scratch, you can choose the one above, or download a different one online and only spend time to input the necessary data. All the necessary calculations and formatting are already done for you.


### Expense Report

The Expense report is used by employees to itemize the expenditures for which they are requesting reimbursement.

Using this template can save you a couple of hours having to create something like this from scratch. 
As you can see in the image below:

This template already has predefined areas and formulas that calculate everything instantly. All you have to do is input the numbers and send the document.
