# What are Formulas?

---
## Content

Formulas are the building blocks of excel. They are used to calculate the values of a cell.

Let's say we wanted to add 3 cells together, for instance, B2, B3, and B4.

We can do so by selecting any empty cell, usually the first cell underneath our 3 cells so we can easily see the result.

After we select the cell, input `= B2+B3+B4`.

This will sum up the 3 cells and display the result.
