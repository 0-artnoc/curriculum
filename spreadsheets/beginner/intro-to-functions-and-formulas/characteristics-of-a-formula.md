# Characteristics of a formula

---
## Content

Formulas are made by the user and start with an equal sign `=`.

Formulas can use any cell and any data type. 

Formulas can also reference cells in other sheets within the same spreadsheet.

For instance, `=(B3+7*2)/C4` is a valid formula that references values from B3 and C4 as well as use some inputted numbers.

However, if in this case B3 or C4 was not a number, we would get this error: `#VALUE!`.
Hovering over will give us this explanation:
```
Error
Function ADD parameter 1 expects number values. But 'z' is a text and cannot be coerced to a number.
```
