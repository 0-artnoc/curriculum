# Strings

## Content

The text type is almost never called *'text'*. Instead, it is refered to as a **string**. The reasoning behind is that it is a **string of characters**. From now on we'll refer to it as **string**.

We've already encountered this type before, when creating the `best_app` variable.Now, let's make another one:

```plain-text
best_user = "You"
```

> ðŸ’¡ Strings **always have to be enclosed by quotation marks** (`" "`). In some programming languages you can also use single quotation marks (`' '`).
