# Data Types

---
## Content

In real-life you can split items into different types. All items of that type have some common characteristics. For example, you could think of a *leaf* as being a type. Although not all leafs look the same, they still have many characteristics in common.

Just as in real-life, everything in programming has a data type. The most common ones are:
- numerical
- text-based
- lists

There are many more types, but you'll start learning them as you dive into a specific programming language. This is because each language might have different implementations of complex data types which can't be generalised, or they are beyond the scope of this course.

Data types are very important! They decide what actions you can take on that piece of data. One good example is that you can't add the number `1` to the text `"one"`.
