# Text

## Content

The text type is almost never called *'text'*. Instead, it is refered to as a **string**. The reasoning behind is that it is a **string/list of characters**. From now on we'll refer to it as **string**.

We've already encountered this type before, when creating the `best_app` variable. Now, let's make another one:

```plain-text
best_user = "You"
```

> ðŸ’¡ Strings **always have to be enclosed by quotation marks** (`" "`). In some programming languages you can also use single quotation marks (`' '`).

## Practice

Strings always have to be enclosed by ???.

* quotation marks
* parentheses
* square brackets
* commas

## Revision

Complete the gaps to define a string:

```plain-text
my_name = "Andrei"
```

* =
* "Andrei"
* Andrei
* ==
