# Variables II

## Content

Now that you know how boxes work ðŸ˜…, variables will be a piece of cake. You store information in them, and give them *labels* (or names).

So, let's create a variable now. We have the `"Enki"` data, and want to store it in our box labeled `best_app`:

When programming, this would usually be done by using the `=` sign:

```
best_app = "Enki"
```

> ðŸ’¡ It's important to mention that `=` means **assign** `"Enki"` to the `best_app` variable. The equality operator is usually represented by `==`. We'll cover how it works in the next posts.
