# Integers

## Content

The *default* numerical type in most programming languages is `integer` (or `int` for short). Integer literally means a whole number and is available in any programming languages. Some examples are `1`, `999`, `-13`.

Depending on the language's use cases, other number types have emerged:
- floating point types are used when you want precise calculations; they allow fractional numerical values, with some examples being `12.33`, `0.0001`, `-13.2`
- complex types for complex mathematical equations; an example would be `13 + 2j`

Let's define an integer!

```plain-text
my_age = 33
```

> ðŸ’¡ Depending on the programming language, you might have to type the data type before the variable name.

## Practice

Choose the correct way to define an integer:

```plain-text
a = "13"

b == 13

c = 13
```

???

* c
* a
* b

## Revision

Create a variable named `age` which stores `33`:

```plain-text
??? ??? ???
```

* age
* =
* 33
* "age"
* ==
