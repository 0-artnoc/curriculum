# Integers

---
## Content

The *default* numerical type in most programming languages is `integer` (or `int` for short). Integer literally means a whole number and is available in any programming languages. Some examples are `1`, `999`, `-13`.

Depending on the language's use cases, other number types have emerged:
- floating point types are used when you want precise calculations; they allow fractional numerical values, with some examples being `12.33`, `0.0001`, `-13.2`
- complex types for complex mathematical equations; an example would be `13 + 2j`

Let's define an integer!

```plain-text
my_age = 23
```

> ğŸ’¡ Depending on the programming language, you might have to type the data type before the variable name.
