# Programming Benefits

## Content

Learning to code will change the way you think. 

> A programmer's wife tells him to go to the shop and buy eggs. After five hours he's still at the shop. When called he says "I'm at the shop buying eggs."

As a programmer, when you encounter a problem you don't go straight to coding. You identify the source, break the problem into manageable bits, and start working incrementally.

> *You'll become solution driven!*

This pattern is not only applicable to programming though. You'll learn to programmatically (pun intended üòÅ) tackle any issue.

We've already mentioned that you could get a promotion, but that's not all. It can also open new opportunities at different jobs. We're living in a rapidly-shifting digital economy, so you never know when it could come in handy.

Learning to code can also be a great bonding experience. You could do it together with your family, significant other, or friends. We guarantee you'll never forget the moments of success (or frustration).
