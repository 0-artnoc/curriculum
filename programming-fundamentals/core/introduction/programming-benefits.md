# Programming Benefits

---
## Content

Learning to code may change the way you think. While coding we often move away from the ambiguities of human languages in favor of clear instructions. This is best explained through a joke:

My wife said: "Please go to the store and buy a carton of milk and if they have eggs, get six.". 

I came back with 6 cartons of milk. 

She said, "Why in the hell did you buy six cartons of milk?"

"They had eggs"

As a programmer, when you encounter a problem you don't go straight to coding. You identify the source, break the problem into manageable bits, and start working incrementally.

> *You'll become solution-driven!*

This pattern is not only applicable to programming though. You'll learn to programmatically (pun intended üòÅ) tackle any issue.

We've already mentioned that you could get a promotion, but that's not all. It can also open new opportunities at different jobs. We're living in a rapidly-shifting digital economy, so you never know when it could come in handy. One thing is certain - our world is rapidly digitalizing and almost any facet of human activity  is more and more reliant on tech.

Learning to code can also be a great bonding experience. You could do it together with your family, significant other, or friends. We guarantee you'll never forget the moments of success (or frustration).
