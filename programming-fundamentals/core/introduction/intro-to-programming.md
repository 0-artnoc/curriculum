# Intro to Programming

---
## Content

This series will serve as an introduction to the Programming topic. It's not meant to be an in-depth guide, but rather an overview of the core features everyone should know before picking up programming.

Programming is nothing more than creating a set of instructions that your computer will follow.

You already interact with programming on a daily basis. From your phone and personal computer to your car and your fridge. Programming is everywhere.

We've come a long way since the 50s (when the first functioning programming languages were created), and these advances make it possible for anyone to learn. Programming is no longer only for scientists.
