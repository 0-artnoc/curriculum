# Why learn to code?

---
## Content

Learning to code **doesn't mean** that you'll have to create the next Twitter or Instagram. Because our lives are dependent on software, learning how it works can bring great benefits.

For example, you could:
- write a program that automatically answers to any incoming emails; better yet, you can decide which person gets what email, or change the email depending on the time of day
- create a website for your product or project; almost everyone has access to internet, so you would get exposure that wouldn't be possible through other means
- get a promotion or a raise in your job; understanding how software works will put you ahead of the curve

These are just a few examples, but you're not limited to them. Knowing fundamentals of programmings will demystify the underworking of the modern digital world.
