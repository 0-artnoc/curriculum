# Hello Code?

---
## Content

In this topic we'll teach you the **very basics** of programming.

We'll cover variables, functions (or methods), conditional statements and loops.

We won't cover any language specific features or advanced concepts.

For the entirety of this course we'll use pseudocode. This is how you write the bare functionality while being language agnostic. When you'll finish this topic, and move on to specific programming languages, you'll be taught that language's [syntax](https://enki.com/glossary/general/syntax).

> ðŸ’¡ When you finish this course, you'll have to decide on your next step. To make things easier, we have some suggestions:
> - Python is a good starting point for your programming career. It's easy to learn, similar to the english language, and powerful
> - If you're ever going to need a database, SQL is a good choice
> - If you want to make your own website, take a look at the Web topic.
