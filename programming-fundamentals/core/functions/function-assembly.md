---
## Content

Your robot is almost ready! The last step is chaining all the functions. You wouldn't want it to prepare the cheese after it fried the sandwich.

```plain-text
Function make a sandwich
  Pass In: prepare ingredients, assemble sandwich, fry sandwich.
  Direct robot to execute prepare ingredients.
  Direct robot to execute assemble sandwich.
  Direct robot to execute fry sandwich.
  Pass Out: grilled cheese sandwich.
Endfunction
```

> ðŸ’¡ You should give your functions explanatory names. A good rule is to use verb-noun combinations (`prepare ingredients`). If your functions requires two verbs or nouns for its identifier, you should probably split it into separate functions.
