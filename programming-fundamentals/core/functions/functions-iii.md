# Functions III

---
## Content

Your robot is almost ready! The last step is chaining all the functions. You wouldn't want it to prepare the cheese after it fried the sandwich.

```plain-text
Function make a grilled cheese
    Pass In: prepare ingredients, assemble sandwich, fry sandwich.
    Direct robot to execute prepare ingredients.
    Direct robot to execute assemble sandwich.
    Direct robot to execute fry sandwich.
    Pass Out: nothing.
Endfunction
```

> üí° You should give your functions explanatory names. A good rule is to use verb-noun combinations (`prepare ingredients`). If your functions requires two verbs or nouns for its identifier, you should probably split it into separate functions.

"Robot, go **make a grilled cheese**". Between the beeping robot sounds, you notice some foulplay. Uh-oh, we instructed the robot to butter the bread instead of the slices üòÖ.

Instead of searching through all the instruction, you know that the issue is in the `assemble sandwich` function:

```plain-text
Function assemble sandwich
    Pass In: bown with cheese, sliced bread, butter.
    Direct the robot to butter the bread slices.
    ...
Endfunction
```

Done. You've fixed your first bug üêõ, and can now enjoy the rest of your Saturday with a grilled cheese. Learning functions couldn't get better!

To recap, functions are useful because:
- they break down big programs into "blocks"
- they increase readability and organization
- they make testing and identifying bugs much easier
