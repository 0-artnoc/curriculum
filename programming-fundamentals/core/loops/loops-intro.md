# Loops Intro

---
## Content

Loops are everywhere in our lives. A good example of a loop is brushing your teeth. You move your hand up-down in five increments. That's what a computer considers a loop.

In programming there are different loops types, with each having their own application. Starting off with the most used one, the counter loop.

Explaining this is simple, you're just teaching a computer how to count while doing some specific actions.

Your robot made a really nice grilled cheese sandwich, so now you want to it to make more for your three other friends. 

You could call the `make sandwich` function multiple times, or repeat the directions inside the function:

```plain-text
Make a sandwich.
Make a sandwich.
... 

// or

Function make sandwiches
  Pass In: ingredients.
  Make a sandwich.
  Make a sandwich.
  ...
  Pass Out: sandwiches.
Endfunction
```

> ðŸ’¡ You can leave comments in your code to explain why you have chosen a certain solution. In pseudocode comments are left using `//`, but each programming language has its own way of defining comments.

When using a low number of repetitions, you wouldn't have any problems repeating the code, but the higher the number the harder and more tedious it gets. 

In programming you should aim to never copy-paste your code. It can lead to many issues, such as changing the code in place without updating all the other occurences.

A better way of achieving this functionality would be by using loops. Whenever you need to repeat a piece of code for a certain number of times, your best bet are loops.

In the following insights we'll talk about the two main types of loops, counter and condition.

## Practice

A counter loops is useful when we want to repeat a piece of code ??? number of times.

* any
* for a small
* for a big

## Revision

What will be the result of this code?

```plain-text
fruit = "Orange"
IF fruit == "Banana" THEN
  Peel fruit.
// ELSE IF fruit == "Orange"
  Eat fruit.
ELSE
  Wash fruit.
```

???

* Wash fruit.
* Eat fruit.
* Peel fruit.
