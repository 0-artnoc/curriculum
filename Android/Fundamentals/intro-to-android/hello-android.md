To create a "Hello Android": 
1. Open Android Studio. The Welcome menu appears. 
2. Click on "Start a New Android Studio Project".  
3. The following information appears:

*	Application Name. The name of your app. When the application is installed on the emulator or the physical device, 
	the name will appear in the application launcher. Click Next
*	Company Domain. This is used to generate a package name and uniquely identify the app.  This feature is used to publish in Google Play Store.
*	Project Location. This is the location in which you want to place your project in. Click Next. 
* 	Target Android Devices. Identifies which application programming interface you want to develop for the project(phone, tablet, wear, TV, or Android Auto). 		Click Next.
*	Add an Activity to Mobile. Select an activity which specifies the default layout for Applications. Click Next. 
*	Customize the Activity. Defines what the initial activity is called. The Activity name can be changed. 
	Layout name(that will be attached to the activity), Title(title of the activity), Menu Resource Name(menu's resource file name) can also be changed. 
	Click Finish.

The project may take some time to create because Gradle is getting built for the first time and it's pulling in all the dependencies that the project requires. 
Select the run button to test your app which looks like a green play button. If there are no errors, you will be prompted to run it on a specific device or on an emulator.
