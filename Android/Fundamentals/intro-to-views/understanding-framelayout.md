## Content

FrameLayout is the simplest type of layout used in Android and is often used to hold layouts that only contain one child view (such as a RecyclerView which is commonly used to display a list of items)

When using a FrameLayout, children views are “stacked” upon each other. The first child view declared will be on the bottom of the “stack” and the last child view will appear on the top of the “stack”. The default position of a view is always anchored at the top left corner.

FrameLayout supports common attributes such as `layout_gravity`, `padding`, and `margin`. Since by default FrameLayout only places child views on top of each other, these attributes can be used to control the amount of overlap between views.
