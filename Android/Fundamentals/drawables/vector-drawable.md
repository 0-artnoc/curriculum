## Content

The advantages of using drawables are: 
* Easy references to strings, drawables, dimensions, themes.
* Automatic support for multiple configurations. 
*	Without changing your code you can have different layouts for landscape and portrait by just having an XML  
  layout in layout-land/ and layout-port/. And you can do the same to adapt the layout to different resolutions, languages, etc.
