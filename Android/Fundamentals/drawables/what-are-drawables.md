## Content

A drawable is a graphic file that can be drawn on the screen and stored as individual files located within the res/drawable folders. Drawables are used to define shapes, colors, borders, gradients, which can be applied to views within that Activity. 
Drawables are used for customizing the view graphics that are displayed within a particular view or context. They are defined in XML and can then be applied to a view XML or Java.

There are many drawables types which can be used in different situations such as drawing shapes, setting state behaviors for buttons, creating stretchable button backgrounds and creating compound drawable layers. Below are a few to understand when using drawables and their usage:

**Shape Drawables** – Defines a shape with properties such as using stroke, filling, and padding.

**StateList Drawables** – Used for different states 

**LayerList Drawables** – Drawables grouped together into a composite result

**NinePatch Drawables** – a png file with stretchable regions to allow proper resizing 

**Vector Drawables** – defines XML based vector images.
