Creating 9 patch PNG image (i.e .9.png image) is very easy but only few of us knows about it. Start with a PNG image, put it in any drawable folder in your project. Below are the following steps:

Steps For converting PNG to 9 Patch PNG
1.	Rename your image file by right-click then Refactor > Rename and change the extension from .png to .9.png .
A 9 patch image is an image that has stretchable areas defined.

These areas are defined in a special 1 pixel wide border around the area. Add black pixels to the top and left of this border to describe where the image can be stretched horizontally and vertically. Nine patch images are especially useful when designing buttons. Custom drawn buttons can look distorted and pixelated when their borders are stretched in addition to the rest of the image.
