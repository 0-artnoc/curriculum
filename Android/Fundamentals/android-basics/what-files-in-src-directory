## Content

The src folder is found in the Project view and contains all codes (application code and android unit test script) and resource files for the following subdirectories: 


The following is the default directory structure for your application and test code:

*  App/src/main/java is the source code of your application build which contains the MainActivity.java file. 
*  App/src/test/java is used for unit testing that can run test without running on a real device or emulator. 
   Unit tests run locally on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Using test minimize execution time when your test have no Android Framework dependencies. 
	
Example of unit test:
```
package com.example.tammy.tammy_test_3;

import org.junit.Test;

import static org.junit.Assert.*;

/**
 * Example local unit test, which will execute on the development machine (host).
 *
 * @see <a href="http://d.android.com/tools/testing">Testing documentation</a>
 */
public class ExampleUnitTest {
    @Test
    public void addition_isCorrect() throws Exception {
        assertEquals(4, 2 + 2);
    }
}
```
*  App/src/androidTest/java is unit test involving android Instrumentation. Instrumentation tests run on a device or an emulator. The app will be installed and then a testing app will also be installed which will control your app, lunching it and running UI tests as needed. Instrumentation tests can be used to test none User Interface. 

Below is an example of Instrumentation unit test:
/**
 * Instrumentation test, which will execute on an Android device.
 *
 * @see <a href="http://d.android.com/tools/testing">Testing documentation</a>
 */
 ```
@RunWith(AndroidJUnit4.class)
public class ExampleInstrumentedTest {
    @Test
    public void useAppContext() throws Exception {
        // Context of the app under test.
        Context appContext = InstrumentationRegistry.getTargetContext();

        assertEquals("com.example.tammy.tammy_test_3", appContext.getPackageName());
    }
}

```

What is AndroidTest?
???

* Used for Instrumentation unit test. 
* Contains source files
* run locally on the Java Virtual Machine

## Revision

What is the purpose of the src folder?
???

* contains all codes such as application code and android unit test script
* part of the gradle script
* src folder does not contain unit tests
