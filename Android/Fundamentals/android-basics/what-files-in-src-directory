## Content

The src folder is found in the Project view and contains all codes (application code and android unit test script) and resource files for the following subdirectories: 

```
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```

The following is the default directory structure for your application and test code:

*  App/src/main/java is the source code of your application build which contains the MainActivity.java file. 
*  App/src/test/java is used for unit testing that can run test without running on a real device or emulator. 
   Unit tests run locally on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Using test minimize execution time when your test have no Android Framework dependencies.
