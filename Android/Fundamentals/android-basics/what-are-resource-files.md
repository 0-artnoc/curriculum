Resource files or res contains the resources for the project. A resource is a file representing something that can be drawn onto the screen, a layout file for your classes, or a value that can be accessed in your app, such as a string or color hex value. 

Types of Resource Files include:
* Drawable. If you app requires local images such as .jpg and .png, then these images can be placed in the drawable folder. 
* Layout. This directory contains XML files that define you appâ€™s user interfaces. 
* Menu. It is used for defining navigation menus and submenus.
*	Mipmap. This directory accepts bitmaps but is used specifically for the app launcher icon. 
*	Values. Contains many XML files consisting of values used in your application including: 
  *	Arrays, colors(hex values), dimensions(text and padding sizes), strings, styles(the look and feel of the app)
