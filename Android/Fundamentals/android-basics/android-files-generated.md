## Content

The Project Tool window displays in the upper left corner as it supports many views. Each view (in the drop-down menu) has similar files but organizes it in a different way. By default, the Android view displays the project files. The Android view divides into an App folder and Gradle Scripts. 

In the Android view, the app section shows the following groups: manifests, java, and the res sub-folder which described below.

* Manifests folder provides metadata for the file.
* Java folder contains java files that stores java source code files and keeps the programming code of an app. 
* Res folder keeps resources - data for the java program. It has many sub-folders such as layouts, strings,
  drawables, mipmaps, values, menu, and bitmap images.
* Gradle Scripts build configuration files, property files, and setting files.
