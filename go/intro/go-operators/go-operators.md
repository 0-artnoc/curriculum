# Operators

---
## Content

In this workout, we will discuss how you can use different operators in `GO` as well as what order of operations `GO` follows.

### What Are Operators?

Operators are symbols used to indicate an operation. 

There are 6 groups of operators you can use.

Arithmetic, Relational, Logical, Assignment, BitWise, and Miscellaneous.

Operators are used to perform calculations, compare values, assign new values to a variable, and more.

### Order Of Operation.

The order of operation that `GO` operators follow is called `PEMDAS` or `BODMAS`.

`PEMDAS` and `BOMDAS` mean the same thing; the former is American and latter is British.

`PEMDAS` stands for:
Parentheses, Exponent, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction.

`BOMDAS` stands for:
Brackets, Orders, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction.

Any calculations done in `GO` follow the above order.

An expression like this one:
```go
11 * (3 + 2) - 4 / 2 
```
```go
would be calculated like this:
11 * (5) - 4 / 2
55 - 4 / 2
55 - 2
53
```

> ðŸ’¡ All, except the Assignment and BitWise operators follow a left-to-right order of operations. Assignment operators follow a right-to-left order.
