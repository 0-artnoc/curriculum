# Data Types

## Content

`GO` support several data types. These are categorized into 4 groups:
- Basic 
- Aggregate
- Reference
- Interface

Right now we will only discuss the basic types.

## Basic data types
```go
Numbers
Strings
Booleans
```

The `number` categories contain several data types corresponding to different number types/sizes.

Integers:

The Strings type are strings, which can be any sequence of characters including numbers.

Boolean types are the smallest type and can only be "True" or "False"
