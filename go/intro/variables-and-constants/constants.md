# Constants

---
## Content

Constants are variables that cannot be updated after they are initialized.

They are useful for creating variables that never need to be changed.

Defining a constants is similar to defining a variable, the difference is the `keyword` thats used.

**Note:** Since `const` values are constants and cannot be chaged later on, it is important to initialize them upon creation.

```go
//Regular variable
var age int = 3

// Constant variable
const age int = 3
```

Constants cannot be declared using the shorthand method `:=`. They are declared the same way on the package and function level.

Also, constants can be any character, string, number or boolean.

## Practice

Define a constant value called `hasKids` of type `bool` and initialize it with the value `false`.

```go
??? ??? ??? = ???
```

* const
* hasKids
* bool
* false
* constant
* False
* HasKids
