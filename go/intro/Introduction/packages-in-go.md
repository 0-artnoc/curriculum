# Packages

---
## Content

All Go programs are made up of one or more package.

Every program in Go starts in the `main` package and there can only be one `main` package.

The top of a file containing Go code contains the *package name*:

```go
// declare that this code
// belongs to the main package
package main

// ...rest of the code
```

> ðŸ’¡ A package name is written in lowercase letters

A package can import any other package using the `import` statement:

```Go
package main

// We can import packages
// one by one, using the
// Multi-statement import
import "fmt"
import "math"
import "zip"
import "json"

// or we can combine the
// imports as a single
// statement, called
// Factored import
import (
  "fmt"
  "math"
  "zip"
  "json"
)
```

> ðŸ’¡ We'll show you soon how imports work within a simple Go program

Both ways work the same, however, it is common practice to use the Factored import as it's quicker to type and easier to change.

> ðŸ’¡ Factoring means calling a keyword once on multiple instances. Later we'll show other Go keywords that can also be factored.

## Practice

Which of these is the common practice way of importing packages in Go?

```go
// Multi-statement import
import "fmt"
import "math"
import "zip"
import "json"

// Factored import
import (
  "fmt"
  "math"
  "zip"
  "json"
)

```

???

* Factored import statement.
* Multi-statement import.

Using the `import` keyword once to import multiple packages is called ??? import
