# Why is GO useful?

---
## Content

The GO language is expressive, concise, clean and efficient.

With GO, compared to other languages, it is easier to write programs that scale on multithreaded CPUs and network software.

Go code compiles insanely fast compared to its predecessor `C` whilst keeping some of the best features of `C`, garbage collections, security features, and performance. 

The syntax is simple enough to learn and understand. The official `Tour of Go` guide with an interactive playground can be found [here](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1).

One of the best features of GO is Concurrency. Most languages don't have strong support for concurrency that GO has.
