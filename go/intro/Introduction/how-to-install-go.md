# How To Install GO

---
## Content

To install `GO` on your machine, first go to the [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/) official website and download the version you need.

The installation process is the same as with any other program on your operating system.

After the installation is done, open any terminal and type:
```go
go version
```

If `GO` was succesfully installed, depending on the version and operating system, you will get a message simillar to this one:
```go
go version go1.14 windows.amd64
```
