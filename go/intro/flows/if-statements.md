# if statements

---
## Content

`If` statements are conditional statements that can have only one outcome.

An `if` statement is used to execute some code if the condition is true.

The syntax of the `if` statement in `GO` is similar to the `for` statement.

You start with the keyword `if` and add a `condition` followed by curly braces `{ }`. 

> ðŸ’¡ You can add or omit the parentheses for the condition. The curly braces are required.

Here is a function that uses an `if` statement to check if a number is positive and returns a string.

```go
func posOrNeg(x float64) string {
    if x > 0 {
        return "x is positive"
    }
    return "x is negative"
}
```

If `x` is greater than `0`, the output would be `x is positive`. If x is not greater it would be `x is negative`.
```go
fmt.Pringln(posOrNeg(100))
// x is positive
fmt.Pringln(posOrNeg(-50))
// x is negative
```

## Practice

Fill in the gaps to make the function return "Correct" if it evaluates to `true` and "Incorrect" if it evaluates to `false`.

```golang
func isItTrue(x float64) string {
    ??? 3 >= 2 {
        ??? "Correct"
    }
    ??? "Incorrect"
}
```
