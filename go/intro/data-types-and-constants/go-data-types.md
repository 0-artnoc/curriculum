# Data Types

---
## Content

**Go** support several data types. These are categorized into four groups:
- Basic 
- Aggregate
- Reference
- Interface

For now, we will only discuss the basic types.

## Basic data types

- Numbers
- Strings
- Booleans

The numbers category contains several data types corresponding to different types and sizes.

Integers:

Strings are nothing more than a sequence of characters **enclosed by quotation marks**. The characters can be anything.

Booleans are the smallest type. They can only take `true` or `false` as a value and are commonly used in decision making.
