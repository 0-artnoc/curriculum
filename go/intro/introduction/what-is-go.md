# Meet Go

## Content

Go is a [statically typed](https://www.enki.com/glossary/general/statically-typed), fast compiled, and [open-source](https://www.enki.com/glossary/general/open-source) language designed by Google.

> ðŸ’¡ A common name for Go is **Golang** because of its website [golang.org](https://golang.org). The domain name go.org wasn't available when the language was created.

Developers in Google wanted to make a new language that supports new multicore machines and large codebases.

They combined several aspects of other programming languages into one. 

**Golang** has the readability and usability of JavaScript or Python. It also has great performance with multiprocessing CPUs and networking.

The language syntax is similar to C++. 

The goal was to make a language that addresses the limitations of other languages. It takes only the good parts and combines them into one that is both fun to write and can build fast programs.

Go was born out of the need for efficiency, safety, and ease of programming.

The language is part of the C-family[1] and has similar [syntax](https://www.enki.com/glossary/general/syntax) but designed with greater simplicity and safety in mind.

It also has a cool mascot, the Gopher!
