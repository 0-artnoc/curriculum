Python 3 was released in 2008 with the goal to simply make Python an easier language to use. 

The goal of this new Python version was to also change the way the language handles strings, consequently enabling it to meet the demands of the language today.

Python 3 is the first Python release which is incompatible with previous Python versions, which is why some people still use Python 2, as they find some packages and libraries to be incompatible with the latest Python version!


One difference is that in Python 3, you must pass the items you want to print explicitly to the function in parentheses as follows:
```python
print ('Python 3')
```

Python 3 is considered to be an improved version of Python 2, with fewer mistakes, and easier for beginners to understand and use.
