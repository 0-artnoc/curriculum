## Content

Python is an entirely object orientated programming language so variables or their types don't need to be declared before using them. 

Each variable in Python is an *object*.

To define an integer:
```python
x = 23;
```
To define a floating point, there are two notations:
```python
x = 7.0
x = float(7)
```
To define a string, you can either use single or double quotes:
```python
str = 'enki'
str = "enki"
```
The only difference between using single and double quotes is that when using double quotes you can use apostrophes without issue, however with single quotes an apostrophe would terminate the string.
