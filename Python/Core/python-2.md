## Content

The final version of Python 2 came out in 2010, and despite Python 3 being the latest generation of the language, many programmers still use this Python version, 2.7.

A big advantage of using Python 2 is that a lot of older libraries and packages only work in Python 2. 

Another advantage of Python 2 is that it has been around for far longer than Python 3, therefore there's more technical support and help available.

One minor difference between Python 2 and 3 is that in Python 2, `print` is treated as a statement instead of a function, therefore there's no need to pass arguments through parentheses; for example:

```python
print 'Python 2'
```
