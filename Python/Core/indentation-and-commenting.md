## Content

Unlike many other programming languages, Python uses indentation for blocks instead of curly braces.

Tabs and spaces are both supported with the standard Python code indentation being four spaces. For example:

```python
indent = 4
if indent == 4:
    print("Python indentation")
```
To comment out lines of code in Python, you must use a hash, `#`. For example:

```python
# print("This line is commented out.")
print("This line isn't commented out!")
```
