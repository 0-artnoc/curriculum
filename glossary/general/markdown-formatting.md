# Markdown Formatting

Before you leave your first comment answer, it might help to brush-up your markdown formatting.

When submitting an answer in the comment section, you'll want to use something like this:

```py
print("So this is markdown!");
```

That is called a code block. To write it, you start with ` ``` ` and end with ` ``` `, just like this:

``````md
```python
# your code
# goes here
```
``````

Notice how we also include `python` after the first ` ``` `. This enables syntax highlighting, a way to colour different parts of the code to make it more readable.

Depending on what you are learning, you can use the following tags: `python`, `javascript`, `sql`, `html`, `css`, `java`, `go`, `bash`, `git`, `docker`, `jsx` or `plain-text`.

When you're leaving a comment, you can press the `Mâ¬‡` button for a markdown cheat-sheet.

You can also press the eye button to preview your comment.
