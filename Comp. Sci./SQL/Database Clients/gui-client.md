GUI Clients on the other hand appear in a separate window and are more preferred by users because of their user friendly interface. These Database Tools can also work with different DBMS's.

Some of them act as web based interfaces such as Adminer, others are just like regular desktop apps.

As an example we will take pgAdmin 4 v1.2.0 on MacOS X. After downloading it will appear as `.dmg` package which you can run directly or install manually (link provided in *learn more* section).

In order to connect to Enki "Pokemon" click "Add new Server" in " Quick Links", fill in all the necessary information and click "Save":
 - host: aws-us-east-1-portal.29.dblayer.com
 - port: 23336
 - dbname: pokemon
 - user: ashketchum
 - password: iwannabetheverybest

Now the connection has been established, for further information read *pgAdmin* documentation.
