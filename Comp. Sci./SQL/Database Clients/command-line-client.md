## Content

Some of the Database Tools have command-line interface, meaning that instead of a separate window or a in browser GUI we will interact with the database through the command line by entering various SQL commands. Examples of such tools are:
 - DbVisualizer
 - pgcli
 - PostgreSQL
 - etc.

As there are many RDBMS's (i.e. databases such as Oracle Database, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server) a lot of Database Client software is built so that it could work with more than one database system.
