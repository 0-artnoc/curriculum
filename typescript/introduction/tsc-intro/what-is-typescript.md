# What is TypeScript?

---
## Content

If you're old enough, you might remember when JavaScript was just a web development language. Due to its versatility, JavaScript is now used in many applications including designing neural networks, building servers and many more.

You're probably thinking "What's JavaScript got to do with it -- isn't this a TypeScript course?". Let us explain!

Because of the popularity of JavaScript, many tools were created to further expand its capabilities, ranging from tools to improve web app development to tools that enable building mobile apps and even backend servers.

> ðŸ’¡ Knowing a little bit of JavaScript is recommended before learning TypeScript. If you'd like to, checkout our JavaScript skill to build up your JS muscles ðŸ’ª.

TypeScript is another creation meant to expand what JavaScript can do.

It is a **strict superset[1] of JavaScript with optional types**.

This means that TypeScript has and always will have all the functionality of JavaScript with the option of using types where needed.

Anything that you can build with JavaScript you can also build with TypeScript.

## Footnotes

[1: Superset]
A set `X` is a superset of set `Y`, if `X` includes all values in `Y`.

For example, the set `"Fruits"` includes all `"Apples"` that exists. This means that `"Fruits"` is a superset of `"Apples"`.
