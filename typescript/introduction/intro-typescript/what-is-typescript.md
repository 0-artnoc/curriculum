# Intro to TypeScript

---
## Content

If you're old enough, you might remember when JavaScript was just a web development language. Due to its versatility, JavaScript is now used in many applications including neural network design, power backends and many more.

You're probably thinking "What's JavaScript got to do with it -- isn't this a TypeScript course?". Let us explain!

Because of the high adoption rate of JavaScript, many tools (such as Angular, React, Node.js, etc) were created to allow programmers to write better/safer JavaScript code. 

TypeScript is another creation meant to put the future of JavaScript in the hands of developers, and it's actually a **superset of JavaScript**. What that means is that TypeScript has all the functionality of JavaScript, but *adds even more*.
