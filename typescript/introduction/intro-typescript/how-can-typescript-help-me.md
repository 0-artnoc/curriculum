# How Can TypeScript Help Me

---
## Content

Knowing that TypeScript is nothing more than JavaScript with extra features, you're ready to find out how you can benefit from using TS.

One of the main features, as its name suggest, is that it allows a lot more control over types. By type checking the code, you can avoid many common bugs and increase the efficiency of your development process.

Interfaces are another feature introduced by TypeScript, and these allow you to specify a structure of types that can be used as arguments to a function, or simply as an expected object.

Here are some other features or benefits you might gain from using TypeScript:
- makes code easier to read and understand
- supports the latest browsers
- supports static typing
- supports generics
- supports modules
